= SEMIC Documentation (public preview)

[.banner]

This website hosts development versions of SEMIC documents. It consolidates two independently developed SEMIC documents: the https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/[SEMIC Style Guide] and the https://semiceu.github.io/core-vocs-handbook[SEMIC Core Vocabularies Handbook]. The website serves two purposes: provides a public review version for collecting feedback and supports editors in their work, particularly for internal pull requests. 

Specific documents can be accessed using the panel on the left or the drop-down list in the lower left corner.

The website publishes multiple development versions, including those from the _develop_ and _feature_ branches, for each document source. The documentation is built with a GitHub action that needs to be triggered manually. A new build can be triggered by following the link here. As a result, versions from the source repository branches will appear on this website.
