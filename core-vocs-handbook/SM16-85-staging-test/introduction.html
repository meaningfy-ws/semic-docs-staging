<h2 id="sec:Introduction"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Handbook explains the role of Core Vocabularies in enabling semantic interoperability at the EU level and provides a practical guide for public administrations to use them. It is intended for business users who wish to understand how the Core Vocabularies can be useful, and for semantic engineers who seek straightforward guidance for specific use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For first-time readers of this Handbook, we recommend starting with the remainder of this section, where <a href="./introduction.adoc#sec:interoperability">interoperability</a> is introduced, the role of <a href="./introduction.adoc#sec:Core_Vocabulary">Core Vocabularies</a> is explained, and the important <a href="./introduction.adoc#sec:use-cases">use cases</a> are summarised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Readers familiar with the SEMIC Core Vocabularies and seeking practical guidance are advised to go directly to the main part of the Handbook, which describes use cases, methodology recommendations, and tutorials for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>creating new semantic data specifications or stand-alone data models by using Core Vocabularies, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mapping existing data models to Core Vocabularies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:Intended_audience"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:Intended_audience"></a>Intended audience</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This handbook is intended for two main audiences: 1) administrative professionals, including policy officers and possibly also legal experts, and 2) technical experts and IT professionals. <br>
Public administrations involve both legal/administrative experts and technical professionals. While they may not always “speak the same language”, they must <strong>work together</strong> to ensure smooth digital transformation. <strong>Semantic interoperability</strong> provides the <strong>common foundation</strong> that allows them to bridge their disciplinary differences and find common ground, <strong>enabling effective collaboration</strong> and thereby contributing to improved public services. Each intended audience will gain new insights relevant for their respective roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_administrative_professionals_legal_experts"><a class="anchor" href="#_administrative_professionals_legal_experts"></a>Administrative Professionals &amp; Legal Experts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By reading this handbook, domain experts will:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understand the role of semantic interoperability at the EU level, which might also be of use at the national, regional, and local level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain insight about how structured data and shared vocabularies enhance legal clarity, data exchange, and cross-border cooperation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain insights into how interoperability supports public services and reduces administrative burdens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is expected that this will facilitate coordination with technical teams to ensure that interoperability initiatives meet both legal and operational requirements and assist the administrative professionals and legal experts in making informed decisions prioritising IT projects that align with interoperability goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_technical_experts_it_professionals"><a class="anchor" href="#_technical_experts_it_professionals"></a>Technical Experts &amp; IT Professionals</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By engaging with this handbook as both a reference manual and a practical guide, the technical experts and IT professionals who design, implement, and maintain the software ecosystem will:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn how to design and implement interoperable systems using the Core Vocabularies and semantic data models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand methodologies for creating, mapping, and integrating semantic data models in their systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to apply best practices for  data exchange, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use standardised approaches to enhance data accessibility, transparency, and reuse in line with FAIR principles [<a href="references.html#ref-88" class="xref page">fair</a>].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure compliance with the <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html">SEMIC Style Guide</a> rules &amp; principles [<a href="references.html#ref-83" class="xref page">sem-sg</a>].</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is expected that this will not only facilitate communication with the domain experts, but also further streamline software development conformant to the user specification and, ultimately, the citizens who benefit from more smoothly functioning digital services.</p>

<h3 id="sec:Structure_of_the_Handbook"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:Structure_of_the_Handbook"></a>Structure of the Handbook</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Handbook has two types of content:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Explanatory Sections</strong>: Intended for administrative professionals and legal experts. They explain interoperability, the role of Core Vocabularies, and describe relevant use cases. It helps non-technical stakeholders understand why semantic interoperability matters and how it supports policy implementation. Each use case is also accompanied by a business case scenario and a user story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practical Guidance Sections</strong>: Designed for technical experts, data architects, and IT professionals, which provide methodologies and step-by-step tutorials for adopting and implementing Core Vocabularies. It includes instructions on creating new semantic data specifications by extending Core Vocabularies, mapping existing data models to them, and ensuring interoperability through standardised practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>structure of the main part of the Handbook</strong> is as follows. First, the notion of <strong>interoperability</strong> and the principal <strong>use cases</strong> will be introduced, which feature the most common, challenging, and interesting scenarios. This is followed by two key chapters, on creating new models and on mapping existing models, which describe and illustrate the principal use cases. For each use case, there is a <strong>description</strong> intended for administrative professionals and legal experts, <strong>guidelines</strong> for implementation that describe procedures how to accomplish the goal of the use case, which are then demonstrated in the <strong>tutorial</strong> for the use case. The guidelines and tutorials are aimed at the technical experts. <br>
Finally, the appendix contains a <strong>glossary of terms</strong>, additional use cases not covered in this handbook, and the references.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:Introduction_to_interoperability"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:Introduction_to_interoperability"></a>Introduction to interoperability</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section introduces what interoperability is, what makes it semantic, and how <strong><em>Core Vocabularies</em></strong>–which is where key concepts are specified in human-readable and machine-processable formats–contribute to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sharing data easily is indispensable for effective and efficient public services. Sharing may be done through offering one point of access, and often involves reusing the data in multiple applications across multiple departments and organisations. To make this work, the information systems need to be interoperable.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="sec:interoperability"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:interoperability"></a>What is interoperability?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf">European Interoperability Framework (EIF)</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-1" class="xref page">eif</a>], interoperability is defined as “the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems”, where, for the purpose of EIF, ‘organisations’ refers to “public administration units or any entity acting on their behalf, or EU institutions or bodies”. It is what “enables administrations to cooperate and make public services function across borders, across sectors and across organisational boundaries”, including enabling “public sector actors to connect, cooperate and exchange data while safeguarding sovereignty and subsidiarity”, as described in the EC communication accompanying the Interoperable Europe Act [<a href="references.html#ref-83" class="xref page">int-eu</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Enabler of benefits</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the context of the public sector, interoperability functions as an enabler of a number of benefits. Among others, it:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>will contribute to GDP growth and will be a cost-saver: an "estimated increase of 0.4% in EU GDP" and saving individuals "up to 24 million hours a year, or EUR 543 million", whereas "[b]usinesses could save 30 billion hours or EUR 568 billion a year." (cited <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC127330">source</a> in [<a href="references.html#ref-83" class="xref page">int-eu</a>])</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will contribute positively to public values, as it already has done for multilingualism and inclusive public services. [<a href="references.html#ref-83" class="xref page">int-eu</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and it is "to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market", both within and between sectors [<a href="references.html#ref-81" class="xref page">dga</a>].</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The requirement for interoperability has been identified at the European Commission (EC) level and different actions and regulations were established to facilitate and support interoperability. The actions stress that data must be shared with a common, agreed-upon, understanding such that the meaning of the data is preserved over time (see [<a href="references.html#ref-1" class="xref page">eif</a>]), when it is shared between co-legislators and across agencies in whole or in part, when it is transferred between systems of different agencies, and when it is used in the various information systems implemented with distinct technologies.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="sec:interoperability-acts"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:interoperability-acts"></a>Existing acts and frameworks related to interoperability</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The European Union has formulated Acts, regulations, and frameworks that intend to foster achieving that, including the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-act">Data Act</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-84" class="xref page">data-act</a>], <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act">Data Governance Act</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-81" class="xref page">dga</a>], the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf">European Interoperability Framework (EIF)</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-1" class="xref page">eif</a>], and the <a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/interoperable-europe/interoperable-europe-act">Interoperable Europe Act</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-3" class="xref page">iea24</a>], which underscore the importance of harmonised data practices across member states. These Acts and frameworks emphasise that true interoperability goes far beyond just connecting systems at a technical level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EU Data Act is a <strong>legislative framework</strong> aimed at enhancing the EU&#8217;s data economy by improving access to data for individuals and businesses. It entered into force on January 11, 2024, and is designed to ensure fairness in data allocation and encourage data-driven innovation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Data Governance Act (DGA) is a <strong>regulation by the European Union</strong> aimed at facilitating data sharing and increasing trust in data usage. It establishes a framework for the reuse of publicly held data and encourages the sharing of data for altruistic purposes, while also regulating data intermediaries to enhance data availability and overcome technical barriers. The act is part of the broader European strategy for data, which seeks to create a more integrated and efficient data economy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EIF provides specific guidance on <strong>how to set up interoperable digital public services</strong>. It gives guidance, through a set of recommendations, to public administrations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Interoperable Europe Act, which entered into force on 11 April 2024, aims to <strong>enhance cross-border interoperability and cooperation</strong> in the public sector across the EU. It is designed to support the objectives of the Digital Decade, ensuring that 100% of key public services are available online by 2030, including those requiring cross-border data exchange. The Act addresses challenges by creating tools for interoperability within public administrations and removing legal, organizational, and technical obstacles. It envisions an emerging ‘network of networks’ of largely sovereign actors at all levels of government, each with their own legal framework and mandates, yet all interconnected”, i.e., for seamless cross-border cooperation, which is to be supported by mandatory assessments. <br></p>

<div class="title">Reasons for interoperability in public administrations</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two key reasons to seek interoperability in public administrations:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Requirements</strong> – EU regulations and policy frameworks such as the <em>Data Act</em>, <em>Data Governance Act</em>, and the <em>Interoperable Europe Act</em> for structured and secure data exchange. Compliance ensures smoother interactions with public authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instrumental Value</strong> – Standardised data and information exchange simplifies cross-border operations, enabling organisations to:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>comply with regulations more easily;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contribute to reducing overhead costs by automating processes and paperwork across ministries that would have to be carried out only once;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>streamline administrative tasks and data accuracy, preventing misinterpretation of data through standardised data exchange;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve service delivery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_semantic_interoperability_and_how_to_achieve_it"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_is_semantic_interoperability_and_how_to_achieve_it"></a>What is semantic interoperability and how to achieve it?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While data exchange is an obvious requirement for interoperability, there are fine but crucial distinctions between data format, syntactic, and semantic interoperability. A standardised syntax and data format to store data lets one exchange data, such as creating an SQL database dump in one tool and seamlessly reopening it in another relational database management system, or lets one send and receive emails that arrive properly in each other’s inbox.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interoperability at the semantic level concerns <strong>the meaning of that data</strong>. One may have the same format and language to represent data, such as XML, but with a tag &lt;bank&gt; … &lt;/bank&gt;, neither the software nor the humans can determine from just that what sort of bank is enclosed within the tags. Such meaning is defined in various artefacts such as vocabularies, thesauri, and ontologies. A &lt;fin:bank&gt; tag in a document may then be an implemented version of its definition at the semantic layer, where the entity has a definition and a number of properties specified in the model (abbreviated with fin), like that the fin:bank is a type of financial organisation with a board of directors and has a location for its headquarters. This enables not only correct sending and receiving of data, but also exchanging data reliably, accessing the right data when querying for information, obtaining relevant data in the query answer, and merging data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interoperability thus consists of a semantic component as well, which "refers to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them" and "<strong>includes developing vocabularies and schemata to describe data exchanges</strong>" [<a href="references.html#ref-85" class="xref page">eif4scc</a>]. According to the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_3&amp;format=PDF">EIF, section 3.5</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-2" class="xref page">eif2</a>], <strong>semantic interoperability</strong> "ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties, in other words ‘what is sent is what is understood’." One recommended way to achieve semantic interoperability between public administrations is to use semantic assets, such as semantic data models, information models, ontologies, and vocabularies. SEMIC uses models called <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/terminological-clarifications.html#sec:what-is-a-cv-specification:~:text=types%20of%20assets.-,What%20is%20a%20Core%20Vocabulary%20(CV)%20specification%3F,-Definition%0AA%20Core"><strong>Core Vocabularies</a></strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="sec:Core_Vocabulary"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:Core_Vocabulary"></a>What is a Core Vocabulary?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong><em>Core Vocabulary (CV)</em></strong> is a basic, reusable, and extensible specification that captures the relevant characteristics of entities, which can be used to add semantics to data and information  in a context-neutral manner [<a href="references.html#ref-5" class="xref page">cv-hb</a>]. Its primary purpose is to provide standardised terms that can be reused across various application domains, typically realised as a <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r2">lightweight ontology</a> (optionally accompanied by a permissive data shape) and documented in a concise specification. Core Vocabularies for SEMIC [<a href="references.html#ref-6" class="xref page">sem-sg-cvs</a>] are maintained by the <a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre">SEMIC action</a> under the <a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/interoperable-europe">Interoperable Europe</a> umbrella of DG DIGIT and are described in the <a href="#sec:SEMIC-Core-Vocabularies">SEMIC Core Vocabularies</a> section below.</p>

<h5 id="sec:Why_Core_Vocabulary"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:Why_Core_Vocabulary"></a>Why Core Vocabularies?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modern-day information system design has moved the goalposts, notably that they typically have to operate in an <strong>ecosystem of tools and data</strong>, which caused a number of new problems, notably:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developers are reinventing the wheel by modelling the same topics over and over again in different organisations, which is a wasteful use of time and other resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequent near-duplications and genuine differences cause, at best, delays in interoperability across systems and, at worst, legally inconsistent data, thereby harming individuals or organisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lack of a high-level common vocabulary causes engineers to create many 1:1 low-level technical mappings between resources that are buried in implementations, which become an unmaintainable mesh structure the more new resources are added and the more often the sources are updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual formats of published datasets require more ad hoc Extract-Transform-Load scripts to reuse commonly reused data, such as cadaster data and registries of companies, imposing a higher burden on tool developers to create and maintain the data processing scripts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Core vocabularies contribute to the solution of all these problems at once thanks to providing agreed-upon shared common building blocks in commonly used domains, such as public services, events, persons and more. Core Vocabularies can be used as, <a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/core-vocabularies">as formulated on the SEMIC Support Centre site</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>a starting point for designing the conceptual data models and application profiles for newly developed information systems, simply through reuse of the terminology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the basis of a particular data model that is used to exchange data among existing information systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>common model to integrate data originating from disparate data sources thanks to the shared terminology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the foundation for defining a common export format for data and thereby facilitating the development of common import mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concretely, let us illustrate the problem versus the solution for languages designed for interoperability, such as XML. The XSD schema and the corresponding XML files that adhere to it help achieve syntactic interoperability for those XML files. It does not achieve interoperability <em>among</em> the XSD schemas, however, because there is no such mechanism to declare that a tag in schema xs1, say, &lt;bank&gt; is the same as &lt;bank&gt; in schema xs2. We need another mechanism to achieve that, which is provided by vocabularies that operate at a higher level of abstraction to which the XSD schemas can be linked: the <em>semantic</em> layer. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, one can avoid the interoperability problem by creating multiple XSD schemas from the same vocabulary which then offers semantic interoperability implicitly. When a developer wants to reuse a Core Vocabulary-based XSD, they only can be used as-is or extended into a more specific application profile, but not modified to the extent that it could to contradict the Core Vocabulary, thereby continuing to foster the intended interoperability.  <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, with Core Vocabularies represented in RDFS or OWL, one can mix vocabularies and link to external concepts, whereas that is not possible with XSD where only types and elements defined in the single schema can be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, an added benefit is that while multilingual XSD is possible through manually created tags to store the multilingual information, such features are already part of standardised vocabulary languages used by the Core Vocabularies, such as SKOS, RDF, RDFS, and OWL, thereby offering a standardised approach to multilingual labels, which facilitates software development, reuse, and interoperability.</p>

<p>The SEMIC Core Vocabularies have been developed following the ‘Process and methodology for developing Core Vocabularies’ [<a href="references.html#ref:23" class="xref page">cv-met</a>] of which the most relevant section is depicted in the figure below. Assuming stakeholders and Working Group members with relevant roles are in place, requirements are defined, which are thoroughly assessed on existing standardisation efforts, evidence, and other data models. When a change is deemed necessary, it enters a drafting phase that focuses on the technical details whilst adhering to the SEMIC Style Guide, followed by public consultations. Thereafter, if deemed necessary based on the feedback, it will undergo another modelling iteration, else the changes are refined and the model finalised. The final model is formally approved, implemented, and documented, ensuring they are well-understood and agreed upon by all relevant parties.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let us commence with a practical example that contributes to setting the stage for defining the use cases afterward.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_practical_example"><a class="anchor" href="#_a_practical_example"></a>A practical example</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine you are starting a business in another EU country. To complete the registration, you need to submit a criminal record certificate and a diploma certificate to multiple public organisations. In many countries, this process is still manual—people must physically visit different ministries, request documents, and submit them in person or via email.  Each organisation may use different formats and terminology, making it difficult for institutions to interpret and process the information correctly. This can generate mistakes during data entry due to terminological confusion that subsequently have to be corrected. Without a common reference vocabulary, these organisations interpret the data differently, making seamless exchange impossible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, imagine an alternative scenario, such as indicated by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/OOTS/OOTSHUB+Home">Once-Only Technical System (OOTS)</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-31" class="xref page">oots</a>] for the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1724&amp;from=EN">Single Digital Gateway Regulation</a> [<a href="references.html#ref-87" class="xref page">sdgr</a>], where this entire process is fully automated. Instead of individuals having to visit multiple offices, the ministries and public administrations would communicate directly with each other, exchanging the necessary information in a structured and consistent manner. The citizen could simply grant approval to the administration office to fetch the data from their home country that already had recorded the relevant data. This would eliminate the need for data re-submission by citizens (according to the once-only principle) and for duplicate document submissions, as well as avoid possible data entry issues and thereby making evidence verification faster. Overall, achieving this degree of data interoperability can considerably reduce burdens for citizens and public administrations in terms of hassle, costs, and mobility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defining the <em>what</em> is one step; the <em>how to achieve it</em> is another.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_how_to_solve_the_scenario_with_semantic_data_specifications"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_to_solve_the_scenario_with_semantic_data_specifications"></a>How to solve the scenario with semantic data specifications</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can different systems and institutions "talk" to each other effectively at the level of software applications and the various types of databases? That technical level uses <strong>data models</strong> to structure the stored data. This first raises the questions of who is developing those data models, and how, and then how those different data models across the database and applications agree on the terminology used in them. Therefore, the challenge is not only technical but also semantic. It is not enough for systems to simply exchange data—they must also be able to interpret the meaning behind the data in a consistent way such that it will not result in errors or so-called 'dirty' (incorrect or incomplete) data. This requires a common language and a (multilingual) structured vocabulary at both the business process level and the IT systems level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where <strong>standards to declare the semantics</strong> play a crucial role. By using <strong>Core Vocabularies</strong>, public administrations can ensure that data and information are structured in a way understood by both humans and machines. Standardised models allow different organisations to recognise and process information without discrepancies, thereby reducing errors and the need for manual intervention. As a result, governments can facilitate seamless data exchange, ensuring that information is accurately expressed, shared, interpreted, and processed across systems, leading to more efficient approvals and interactions for businesses, governmental organisations, and citizens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These vocabularies can then be used by the IT personnel of the various departments to create their data models, thereby in effect <strong>avoiding incompatibility</strong> <strong>by building interoperability into the systems from the start</strong>. But what about existing systems from, e.g., a Ministry of Economic Affairs, a national Chamber of Commerce, and other organisations that are relevant to the Single Digital Gateway? Setting aside existing systems to build a new one may not be reasonable and cost effective, especially when they already have their own entrenched terminologies embedded into them or have already incorporated other models used internationally, such as <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a> or the <a href="https://edmcouncil.org/frameworks/industry-models/fibo/">Financial Business Industry Ontology</a>. There is a solution to that problem, too: <strong>map the specifications at this semantic layer to make the other model interoperable with the CV</strong> and then use both through that declared mapping ‘bridge’ between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is these two key ways of using CVs that will be covered in the use cases: creating new data specifications availing of the CVs (possibly adding one’s own additional content to it) and mapping existing schemas.</p>

<h4 id="sec:use-cases"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:use-cases"></a>Introduction to the use cases covered in the handbook</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This handbook serves as a practical guide for using Core Vocabularies in various common situations. To provide clear and actionable insights, we have categorised potential use cases into two groups:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Business and Technical Use Cases</strong>: These are the most common, interesting, and/or challenging scenarios, all thoroughly covered within this handbook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Business and Technical Use Cases</strong>: These briefly introduce other relevant scenarios but are not elaborated on in detail in this handbook.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>business case</strong> in the current context is to be understood as a narrative user story (in terms of the technical expert terminology), which functions as <strong>motivation for the use case</strong>. They capture the who, what, and why in a broader context, including who the beneficiary of an action is, what they need, and what the benefit of it is. Such a narrative is then structured into a <strong>user story</strong> as a structured sentence that captures the essence of the business case yet also communicates genericity. For the technical reader, a <strong>use case specification</strong> is listed afterwards, which provides a schematic view as a step towards the precise technical specifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We differentiate between use cases focused on the creation of <em>new</em> artefacts and those involving the mapping of <em>existing</em> artefacts to Core Vocabularies. For better clarity, we numbered the use cases and organised them into two diagrams, one for the primary scenarios (see Figure 1, below) and the other for depicting the additional ones. The former are addressed in the main part of this handbook, whereas the latter are listed in the <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/core-vocs-handbook/blob/develop/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/additional-use-cases.adoc">Appendix</a> and may be elaborated on at a later date if there is a demand from the community.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use cases are written in white-box point of style oriented towards user goals following Cockburn’s classification [<a href="https://meaningfy-ws.github.io/semic-docs-staging/core-vocs-handbook/develop/references.html#ref:30">uc-book</a>].

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For mapping vocabularies, there are two business cases for illustration. In short:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>UC2.1:</strong> Sofía with the Department of Agriculture’s outreach division wants to map her existing conceptual model about outreach events that already uses the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) and align it with Schema.org. This way, the event data can be distributed across the interoperable Europe and global web vocabularies, enabling a wider reach of accurate data exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UC2.2.:</strong> Ella, working for the National Registry of Certified Legal Practitioners, wants to map her existing XML Schema Definition (XSD) to the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). This enables her to transform the XML data into semantically enriched RDF such that it complies with European interoperability standards and supports linked data publication, and thereby enabling cross-system data exchange.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main use case UC2 is summarised as follows, which is subsequently refined into two specific ones. They serve as a quick overview; concrete scenarios are introduced in the dedicated “Description” section.</p>
