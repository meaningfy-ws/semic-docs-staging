Sharing may be through offering one point of access, and often involves reusing the data in multiple applications across multiple departments and organisations. To make this work, the systems need to be interoperable. Following the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), interoperability is defined as “the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems”, where, for the purpose of EIF ‘organisations’ refers to “public administration units or any entity acting on their behalf, or EU institutions or bodies”. It is what “enables administrations to cooperate and make public services function across borders, across sectors and across organisational boundaries.”, including enabling “public sector actors to connect, cooperate and exchange data while safeguarding sovereignty and subsidiarity”, as described in EUR-Lex-52022DC0710. The requirement for interoperability has been identified at the European Commission (EC) level and consequently different actions and regulations are established to facilitate and support interoperability (summarised below). They stress that data must be shared with a shared understanding EIF such that the meaning of the data is preserved over time, when it is shared between co-legislators and across agencies in whole or in part, when it is transferred between systems of different agencies, and when it is used in the various information systems implemented with distinct technologies. In the context of public sector interoperability specifically, it functions as an enabler of a number of benefits. Among others, the EC has identified in EUR-Lex-52022DC0710 that it will contribute to GDP growth and will be a cost-saver: an \"estimated increase of 0.4% in EU GDP\" and saving individuals \"up to 24 million hours a year, or EUR 543 million\", whereas \"[b]usinesses could save 30 billion hours or EUR 568 billion a year.\" (cited source) will contribute positively to public values, as it already has done for multilingualism and inclusive public services. and it is \"to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market\" both within and between sectors (Data governance act). Mechanisms that foster interoperability contribute to improving individuals’ and businesses’ access to data to encourage data-driven innovation and a more integrated and efficient data economy. A prerequisite for this is that the data must have a clearly specified meaning so that it will be used correctly by all users sharing the same understanding about that data. This, in turn, also contributes to clear data provenance and correctness for the data stored and used, which is important for increasing trust and data availability. These capabilities could further contribute to consistent interpretation and foster reliable data sharing and access across multiple sectors and administrative levels, which may also contribute to policymaking and implementation. The European Union has formulated Acts, regulations, and frameworks that intend to foster achieving that, including the Data Act, the Data Governance Act, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), and the Interoperable Europe Act, which underscore the importance of harmonised data practices across member states. These Acts and frameworks emphasise that true interoperability goes far beyond just connecting systems at a technical level. The EU Data Act is a legislative framework aimed at enhancing the EU’s data economy by improving access to data for individuals and businesses. It entered into force on January 11, 2024, and is designed to ensure fairness in data allocation and encourage data-driven innovation. The Data Governance Act (DGA) is a regulation by the European Union aimed at facilitating data sharing and increasing trust in data usage. It establishes a framework for the reuse of publicly held data and encourages the sharing of data for altruistic purposes, while also regulating data intermediaries to enhance data availability and overcome technical barriers. The act is part of the broader European strategy for data, which seeks to create a more integrated and efficient data economy. The EIF provides specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services. It gives guidance, through a set of recommendations, to public administrations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. The Interoperable Europe Act, which entered into force on 11 April 2024, aims to enhance cross-border interoperability and cooperation in the public sector across the EU. It is designed to support the objectives of the Digital Decade, ensuring that 100% of key public services are available online by 2030, including those requiring cross-border data exchange. The Act addresses challenges by creating tools for interoperability within public administrations and removing legal, organizational, and technical obstacles. It envisions an emerging ‘network of networks’ of largely sovereign actors at all levels of government, each with their own legal framework and mandates, yet all interconnected”, i.e., for seamless cross-border cooperation, which is to be supported by mandatory assessments. To achieve interoperability, one has to elucidate its multiple interacting sub-components. This could be along the line of the high-level conceptual model of the EIF, which intersects with national interoperability frameworks and domain-specific interoperability frameworks such as the INSPIRE Directive. In the EIF toolbox, each higher layer rests upon an interoperable lower layer of infrastructure; e.g., organisational interoperability requires semantic operability such that information can be exchanged seamlessly, which, in turn, requires IT infrastructure interoperability. They also can be viewed as layers of local, provincial, national, and EU-wide levels of interoperability to accommodate a plethora of e-Government information exchange scenarios or smart cities and communities specifically (EIF4SCC). Alternatively, an interoperability framework can be envisioned as foundations upon which government services are built (MIOS), or as one of the constituent pillars that enable goals such as citizen convenience, increased productivity, and lower costs of government operations. In sum, there are two key reasons to seek interoperability in public administrations: Instrumental Value – Standardised data and information exchange simplifies cross-border operations, enabling organisations to: comply with regulations more easily; contribute to reducing overhead costs by automating processes and paperwork across ministries that would have to be carried out only once; streamline administrative tasks and data accuracy, preventing misinterpretation of data through standardised data exchange; improve service delivery. Legal Requirements – EU regulations and policy frameworks such as the Data Act, Data Governance Act, and the Interoperable Europe Act for structured and secure data exchange. Compliance ensures smoother interactions with public authorities. While data exchange is an evident requirement for interoperability, there are fine but crucial distinctions between data format, syntactic, and semantic interoperability. A standardised syntax and data format to store data lets one exchange data, such as creating an SQL database dump in one tool and seamlessly reopening it in another, or lets one send and receive emails that arrive properly in each other’s inbox. Interoperability at the semantic level concerns the meaning of that data. One may have a format and language to represent data, such as XML, but with a tag … , neither the software nor the humans can determine from just that what sort of bank is enclosed within the tags. Such meaning is defined in artefacts including vocabularies, thesauri, and ontologies. A “” tag in a document is then an implemented version of its definition at the semantic layer, where it has a definition and a number of properties specified, like that the fin:bank is a type of organisation with a board of directors and a location for its headquarters. This enables not only correct sending and receiving of data, but also exchanging data reliably, accessing the right data when querying for information and obtaining relevant data in the query answer, and merging data. According to the Revised EIF, section 3.5, semantic interoperability \"ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties, in other words ‘what is sent is what is understood’.\" Besides aforementioned syntactic interoperability, it has the semantic component as well, which \"refers to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them.\" and \"includes developing vocabularies and schemata to describe data exchanges\". One recommended way to achieve semantic interoperability between public administrations is to use Core Vocabularies, which is where the terms are specified and disambiguated. A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable, and extensible specification that captures the relevant characteristics of entities, which can be used to add semantics to data and information that captures the essential characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral manner. Its primary purpose is to provide standardised terms that can be reused across various application domains, typically realised as a lightweight ontology (optionally accompanied by a permissive data shape) and documented in a concise specification. Core vocabularies for SEMIC were created as part of the ISA2 program and are described further below in the Core Vocabularies section. Imagine you are starting a business in another EU country. To complete the registration, you need to submit a criminal record certificate and a diploma certificate to multiple public organisations. In many countries, this process is still manual—people must physically visit different ministries, request documents, and submit them in person or via email. Each organisation may use different formats and terminology, making it difficult for institutions to interpret and process the information correctly, possibly making mistakes during data entry due to terminological confusion that subsequently have to be corrected. Without a common reference vocabulary, these organizations interpret the data differently, making seamless exchange impossible. Now, imagine an alternative scenario, such as indicated by the Once-Only Technical System (OOTS) for the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, where this entire process is fully automated. Instead of individuals having to visit multiple offices, the ministries and public administrations would communicate directly with each other, exchanging the necessary information in a structured and consistent manner. The citizen could simply grant approval to the administration office to fetch the data from their home country that already had recorded the relevant data. This would eliminate the need for duplicate document submissions and avoid possible data entry issues, thereby reducing the hassle and costs of mobility. This is also the aim of the . Defining the what is one step; the how to achieve it is another. How can different systems and institutions \"talk\" to each other effectively at the level of software applications and databases? The challenge is not only technical but also semantic. It is not enough for systems to simply exchange data—they must also be able to interpret the meaning behind the data in a consistent way such that it will not result in errors or so-called 'dirty' (incorrect or incomplete) data. This requires a common language and a (multilingual) structured vocabulary at both the business process level and the IT systems level. This is where standards to declare the semantics play a crucial role. By using core vocabularies, public administrations can ensure that data and information are structured in a way understood by both humans and machines. Standardised models allow different organisations to recognise and process information without discrepancies, therewith reducing errors and the need for manual intervention. As a result, governments can facilitate seamless data exchange, ensuring that information is accurately shared, interpreted, and processed across systems, leading to more efficient approvals and interactions for businesses, governmental organisations, and citizens. This handbook is intended for two main audiences: 1) administrative professionals and legal experts, and 2) technical experts and IT professionals. Public administrations involve both legal/administrative experts and technical professionals. While they may not always “speak the same language”, they must work together to ensure smooth digital transformation. Semantic interoperability provides the common foundation that allows them to bridge their disciplinary differences and find common ground, enabling effective collaboration and thereby contributing to improved public services. Each intended audience will gain new insights relevant for their respective roles By reading this handbook, domain experts will Understand the role of semantic interoperability at the EU level, which might also be of use at the national, regional, and local level. Gain insight about how structured data and shared vocabularies enhance legal clarity, data exchange, and cross-border cooperation. Gain insights into how interoperability supports public services and reduces administrative burdens. It is expected that this will facilitate coordination with technical teams to ensure that interoperability initiatives meet both legal and operational requirements and assist the administrative professionals and legal experts in making informed decisions about financing and prioritising IT projects that align with interoperability goals. By engaging with this handbook as both a reference manual and a practical guide, the technical experts and IT professionals who design, implement, and maintain the software ecosystem will: Learn how to design and implement interoperable systems using Core Vocabularies and semantic data models. Understand methodologies for creating, mapping, and integrating semantic data models in public administration systems. Be able to apply best practices for data exchange, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different systems. Use standardised approaches to enhance data accessibility, transparency, and reuse in line with FAIR principles. Ensure compliance with Semic style-guide principles. It is expected that this will not only facilitate communication with the domain experts, but also further streamline software development conformant to the user specification and, ultimately, the citizens who benefit from more smoothly functioning digital services. The SEMIC Core Vocabularies Handbook is designed to practically guide public administrations in achieving semantic interoperability. It provides clear guidance on how to use core vocabularies to create semantic data specifications that align with EU initiatives, how to reuse them, and how to implement them. Additionally, it outlines key use cases demonstrating practical applications of these vocabularies. The Handbook has two types of content: Explanatory Sections: Intended for administrative professionals and legal experts. They explain the role of Core Vocabularies, along with relevant use cases and a conceptual framework. It helps non-technical stakeholders understand why semantic interoperability matters and how it supports policy implementation. Practical Guidance Sections: Designed for technical experts, data architects, and IT professionals, which provide methodologies and step-by-step tutorials for adopting and implementing Core Vocabularies. It includes instructions on creating new semantic data specifications by extending Core Vocabularies, mapping existing data models to them, and ensuring interoperability through standardised practices. The structure of the main part of the handbook is as follows. First, several principal use cases will be introduced, which feature the most common, challenging, and interesting scenarios. It is augmented with other scenarios to indicate further possible usage. This is followed by guidelines for implementation, which includes procedures for how to create new models and how to map existing ones. These guidelines are demonstrated in the tutorials and examples for the use cases. Finally, the appendix contains a glossary of terms for easy reference and usecases not covered in this handbook.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"Introduction to interoperability","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/Introduction%20to%20interoperability.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction to interoperability","hash":"_introduction_to_interoperability","id":1},{"text":"What is interoperability","hash":"_what_is_interoperability","id":2},{"text":"Why is interoperability needed?","hash":"_why_is_interoperability_needed","id":3},{"text":"Existing acts and frameworks","hash":"existing-acts","id":4},{"text":"What is semantic interoperability and how to achieve it","hash":"_what_is_semantic_interoperability_and_how_to_achieve_it","id":5},{"text":"What is a Core Vocabulary?","hash":"_what_is_a_core_vocabulary","id":6},{"text":"A Practical Example","hash":"_a_practical_example","id":7},{"text":"Who shall read this Handbook","hash":"_who_shall_read_this_handbook","id":8},{"text":"Administrative Professionals & Legal Experts","hash":"_administrative_professionals_legal_experts","id":9},{"text":"Technical Experts & IT Professionals","hash":"_technical_experts_it_professionals","id":10},{"text":"How this Handbook is structured","hash":"_how_this_handbook_is_structured","id":11}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Use case 1.2 to create a new JSON-LD context definition is specified as follows. Use Case UC1.2: Create a new JSON-LD context definition Goal: Create a new standalone JSON-LD context definition that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new JSON-LD context definition that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, a JSON-LD context definition can be integrated in describing data, building APIs, and other operations involved in information exchange. Example: Core Person Vocabulary [cpv-json-ld], Core Business Vocabulary [cbv-json-ld] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for use cases will be provided in the Create a new JSON-LD context definition section. This section provides guidelines for addressing use case UC1.2. JSON-LD is a W3C Recommendation for serialising Linked Data, combining the simplicity, power, and Web ubiquity of JSON with the concepts of Linked Data. Creating JSON-LD context definitions facilitates this synergy. This ensures that when data is shared or integrated across systems, it maintains its meaning and can be understood in the same way across different contexts. This guide describes how to create new JSON-LD contexts for existing Core Vocabularies. The three key phases are: Import or define elements Shape structure Review and validate When a Core Vocabulary has defined an associated JSON-LD context already, it is not only easy, but also advisable to directly import this context using the @import keyword. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. In cases where the Core Vocabulary does not provide an JSON-LD context, it is necessary to create the corresponding field element definitions for the reused URIs. To start, gather all the terms from the selected Core Vocabulary that need to be included in the JSON-LD context. Then, decide the desired structure of the JSON-LD file, by defining the corresponding keys, such as Person.givenName. These new fields must adhere to the naming defined by the selected Core Vocabulary to maintain consistency. Finally, assign URIs to keys. Each term in the JSON-LD context must be associated with a URI from an ontology that defines its meaning in a globally unambiguous way. Associate the URIs established in Core Vocabularies to JSON keys using the same CV terms. The ones that are imported by the Core Vocabularies, shall be used as originally defined. Start with defining the structure of the context by relating class terms with property terms and then, if necessary, property terms with other classes. Commence by creating a JSON structure that starts with a @context field. This field will contain mappings from one’s own vocabulary terms to other’s respective URIs. Continue by defining fields for Classes and subfields for their properties. If the JSON-LD context is developed with the aim of being used directly in exchange specific to an application scenario, then aim to establish a complete tree structure that starts with a single root class. To do so, specify precise @type references linking to the specific Class. If the aim of the developed JSON-LD context is rather ensuring semantic correspondences, without any structural constraints, which is the case for core or domain semantic data specification, then definitions of structures specific to each entity type and its properties suffice, using only loose references to other objects. To meet wishes from API consumers, one may use aliasing of keywords, where a JSON-LD context element is given a more easily recognisable string. One can also extend the context by reusing terms from Core Vocabularies, which also uses the @import keyword if included as a whole. Alternatively, single elements can be added, such as additional properties and mapping those to other vocabulary elements of other vocabularies. First, one should review the created context against any prior requirements that may have been described: is all prospected content indeed included in the context? Second, the syntax should be verified with a JSON-LD validator, such as JSON-LD Playground to ensure that the context is free of errors and all URLs used are operational. Public administrations often need to share information about their services with other organisations and the public. To do this effectively, the data must be easy to understand and work seamlessly across different systems. However, public services are becoming more complex, which means we need to capture more details, concepts, and relationships to handle various use cases. The Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) provides a generic framework to describe public services in a machine-readable way. It helps public administrations share and organise information about services. However, sometimes CPSV-AP needs to be extended with new concepts or restrictions to address more general or specific use cases. For example, the terms Service and RequiredEvidence were introduced in CPSV-AP-NO to extend the CPSV-AP model such that it can fulfil the specific needs identified in Norway, where: Service allows for describing not only public services but also general ones, enabling the representation of services provided through partnerships or private organisations. RequiredEvidence provides a way to explicitly define the documentation or credentials needed to access a service, such as proof of address for health insurance registration. To make CPSV-AP more flexible and useful, creating a JSON-LD context is essential. JSON-LD helps structure the data so it can be easily shared and understood by different systems. This tutorial addresses the use case UC1.2, and will show how to create a JSON-LD context for an Application Profile that extends CPSV-AP with new concepts like Service and RequiredEvidence, which are defined by reusing concepts from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), following ideas from CPSV-AP-NO. By extending CPSV-AP and using JSON-LD, public administrations can better organise their data, making it easier to share and integrate across systems while supporting a wider range of use cases. Since CPSV-AP provides an existing JSON-LD context, we can import it in our own JSON-LD context using the @import statement. For example, in case of CPSV-AP version 3.2.0, the context can be directly reused like this: { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } } If a context that we can reuse does not exist, define the elements explicitly. For example, CPSV-AP uses specific terms such as PublicService and ContactPoint. These terms must be mapped to URIs. { \"@context\": { \"PublicService\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"ContactPoint\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/ContactPoint\" } } If a context needs to be extended, define the new elements explicitly. For example, if we need new terms (classes), such as Service and RequiredEvidence, which are not in CPSV-AP these terms must be mapped to URIs (the examples are inspired from CPSV-AP-NO) : { \"@context\": { \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"RequiredEvidence\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\" } } Once you’ve imported or defined the relevant terms, you need to structure your JSON-LD context to reflect the relationships between the classes and their properties. This allows you to describe public services and their details in a standardised and machine-readable format. Let’s look at an example where we define a Service and some of its key properties, such as contactPoint, description, name and hasRequiredEvidence. { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"Service.hasRequiredEvidence\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.description\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.name\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.contactPoint\": { \"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"@id\", \"@container\": \"@set\" } } } @context: Defines the mapping between terms (e.g., PublicService) and their corresponding IRIs. @container: Specifies how values are structured. For instance, @set: Explicitly defines a property as an array of values. It ensures that even if the data includes just one value, it will still be treated as an array by JSON-LD processors. This makes post-processing of JSON-LD documents easier as the data is always in array form, even if the array only contains a single value @id: Provides the unique identifier (IRI) for a term or property. @type: Specifies the type of a value. Commonly used for linking to classes or data types. @import: Imports another JSON-LD context, allowing reuse of its terms. After defining the context and structure, you can now describe an actual Service instance by referencing the terms you defined earlier. Let’s assume a public administration offers a service called \"Health Insurance Registration\". This service allows citizens to register for health insurance, which requires certain documents (evidence) to complete the process. Citizens might need to contact the administration for guidance, and the service details should be structured in a way that makes it easy to share and integrate across systems. To illustrate this, we’ve created a JSON-LD context representation of this service, highlighting The required evidence for registration (e.g., Proof of Address). The service’s name and description for clarity. Contact information for users who may need assistance. Try this in JSON-LD Playground here { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" } } When working with REST APIs, it is often beneficial to alias certain JSON-LD keywords for simpler or more consistent representations in client applications. For example, you might alias JSON-LD’s @id to url and @type to type to make the data more intuitive for API consumers, especially when working with legacy systems or client-side frameworks that use specific naming conventions. { \"@context\": { \"url\": \"@id\", \"type\": \"@type\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.name\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.description\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\" }, \"url\": \"http://example.com/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"type\": \"Service\", \"Service.name\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"Service.description\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\" } In this example: url is an alias for @id type is an alias for @type By aliasing these terms, the API responses are simplified and more familiar to the developers interacting with the service, especially if they are accustomed to a different JSON structure. To highlight the reuse of terms from existing CVs, we can import the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) context alongside the CPSV-AP context to gain access to business-related terms. This step ensures that you can use the additional terms from CBV, such as LegalEntity, Organisation, and ContactPoint, to enrich your Service descriptions. { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" }, { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\" } ] } Add CBV terms to enhance the description of the Service entity. { \"@context\": { \"Service.providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/legal#providedBy\", \"@type\": \"http://example.com/legal#LegalEntity\" }, \"LegalEntity\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity\" } } Use the extended properties to describe more aspects of Service instances. For example: { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\", { \"ex\": \"http://example.org/\" } ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"ex:providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.org/legalEntity/healthDepartment\", \"@type\": \"LegalEntity\" } } Use an online tool such as the JSON-LD Playground to validate JSON-LD context and make sure there are no errors. If the @import URLs for external contexts are incorrect or unavailable, the validation tool may display an error such as: \"Error loading remote context\" or \"Context could not be retrieved.\" { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://invalid-url/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } ] } These errors typically occur when the referenced context URL is malformed or unreachable, as shown in the following figure: Ensure that the @import URLs point to valid and accessible JSON-LD contexts. Verify the links in a browser or test them in a cURL command to ensure they return the correct JSON-LD data. Update the URLs to the correct ones.","title":"Create a new JSON-LD context definition","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"UC1.2-description","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/UC1.2-description.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Guideline to create a new JSON-LD context definition","hash":"sec:create-a-new-json-ld-context-definition","id":2},{"text":"Import or define elements","hash":"_import_or_define_elements","id":3},{"text":"Shape structure","hash":"_shape_structure","id":4},{"text":"Main shaping of the structure","hash":"_main_shaping_of_the_structure","id":5},{"text":"Improvements to the structure","hash":"_improvements_to_the_structure","id":6},{"text":"Review and validate","hash":"_review_and_validate","id":7},{"text":"UC 1.2 tutorial on creating JSON-LD context","hash":"sec:create-a-json-ld-definition","id":8},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":9},{"text":"Steps to create a JSON-LD context","hash":"_steps_to_create_a_json_ld_context","id":10},{"text":"Import or define elements:","hash":"_import_or_define_elements_2","id":11},{"text":"Shape the structure","hash":"_shape_the_structure","id":12},{"text":"Explanation of JSON-LD keywords used","hash":"_explanation_of_json_ld_keywords_used","id":13},{"text":"Example of a simple service instance","hash":"_example_of_a_simple_service_instance","id":14},{"text":"Example scenario","hash":"_example_scenario","id":15},{"text":"Aliasing keywords for API compatibility (REST API example)","hash":"_aliasing_keywords_for_api_compatibility_rest_api_example","id":16},{"text":"Example of aliasing keywords","hash":"_example_of_aliasing_keywords","id":17},{"text":"Extend the context by reusing terms from Core Vocabularies","hash":"_extend_the_context_by_reusing_terms_from_core_vocabularies","id":18},{"text":"Define additional properties from the Core Business Vocabulary","hash":"_define_additional_properties_from_the_core_business_vocabulary","id":19},{"text":"Map extended properties in a service instance:","hash":"_map_extended_properties_in_a_service_instance","id":20},{"text":"Final review and validation","hash":"_final_review_and_validation","id":21},{"text":"Error example:","hash":"_error_example","id":22},{"text":"How to fix:","hash":"_how_to_fix","id":23}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"Use Case UC2.1: Map an existing Ontology to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping between the terms of an existing ontology and the terms of Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping expressed in Semantic Web terminology (for example using rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, owl:sameAs properties), associating the terms in an existing ontology that defines relevant concepts in a given domain, to terms defined in one or more CVs. This activity is usually performed by a semantic engineer based on input received from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping associates the terms in an existing ontology, which defines relevant concepts within a specific domain, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. The result of the formal mapping can be used later by software engineers to build information exchange systems. Example: Mapping Core Person to Schema.org [map-cp2org], Core Business to Schema.org [map-cb2org], etc. Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing Ontology section. This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC2.1. In this section we adopt the definition from this paper of the following concepts: Ontology matching: the process of finding relationships or correspondences between entities of different ontologies. Ontology alignment: a set of correspondences between 2 or more ontologies, as outcome of ontology matching process. Ontology mapping: the oriented, or directed, version of an alignment, i.e., it maps the entities of one ontology to at most one entity of another ontology. To create an ontology alignment, the following steps need to be observed: Staging: defining the requirements Characterisation: defining source and target data and performing data analysis Reuse: discover, evaluate, and reuse existing alignments Matching: execute and evaluate matching Align and map: prepare, create the alignment, and render mappings Application: make the alignment available for use in applications This methodology has been used in mapping the Core Vocabularies to Schema.org. This work is available on the SEMIC GitHub repository dedicated to Semantic Mappings, and documented here. Next sections describe this methodology in more detail. This initial phase involves a comprehensive understanding of the project’s scope, identifying the specific goals of the mapping exercise, and the key requirements it must fulfil. Stakeholders collaborate to articulate the purpose of the ontology or data model alignment, setting clear objectives that will guide the entire process. Defining these requirements upfront ensures that subsequent steps are aligned with the mapping exercise overarching goals, stakeholder expectations and fitting the use cases. Inputs: Stakeholder knowledge, project goals, available resources, domain expertise. Outputs: Mapping project specification document comprising a defined mapping project scope and comprehensive list of requirements. In this stage, a thorough analysis of both source and target ontologies is conducted to ascertain their structures, vocabularies, and the semantics they encapsulate. This involves an in-depth examination of the conceptual frameworks, data representation languages, and any existing constraints within both models. Understanding the nuances of both the source and target is critical for identifying potential challenges and opportunities in the mapping process, ensuring that the alignment is both feasible and meaningful. The following is an indicative, but not exhaustive, list of aspects to consider in this analysis: specifications documentation, representation language and representation formats, deprecation mechanism, inheritance policy (single inheritance only or multiple inheritance are also allowed), natural language(s) used, label specification, label conventions, definition specification, definition conventions, version management and release cycles, etc. Inputs: Source and target ontologies, initial requirements, domain constraints. Outputs: Analysis reports comprising a comparative characterisation table, identified difficulties, risks and amenability assessments, selected source and target for mapping. In the ontology mapping lifecycle, the reuse stage is pivotal, facilitating the integration of pre-existing alignments into the project’s workflow. Following the initial characterisation, this stage entails discovery and a rigorous evaluation of available alignments against the project’s defined requirements. These requirements are instrumental in appraising whether an existing alignment can be directly adopted, necessitates modifications for reuse, or if a new alignment should be constructed from the ground up. Ontology alignments are often expressed in Alignment Format (AF) or EDOAL. An example statement in a Turtle file representing an ontology alignment (taken from the Core Business Vocabulary to Schema.org alignment), could look something like this: a align:Cell; align:entity1 ; align:entity2 ; align:relation \"=\"; align:measure \"1\"^^xsd:float; owl:annotatedProperty owl:equivalentClass; sssom:mapping_justification semapv:MappingReview . The outcome of this stage splits into three distinct pathways: direct reuse of alignments that are immediately applicable, adaptive reuse where existing alignments provide a partial fit and serve as a basis for refinement (i.e. we can improve certain alignment statements, or add new statements in the alignment map), and the initiation of a new alignment when existing resources are not suitable. This structured approach to reuse optimises resource utilisation, promotes efficiency, and tailors the mapping process to the project’s unique objectives. Inputs: repository of existing alignments (for the source and target ontologies), evaluation criteria based on requirements. Outputs: Assessment report on existing alignments, decisions on reuse, adaptation, or creation of a new alignment. This section delves into automatic and semi-automatic approaches to finding the alignment candidates. However, in cases of small vocabularies and ontologies fully manual efforts are likely more efficient. Utilising both automated tools and manual expertise, this phase focuses on identifying potential correspondences between entities in the source and target models. The matching process may employ various methodologies, including semantic similarity measures, pattern recognition, or lexical analysis, to propose candidate alignments. These candidates are then critically evaluated for their accuracy, relevance, and completeness, ensuring they meet the predefined requirements and are logically sound. This stage is delineated into three main activities: planning, execution, and evaluation. In the planning activity, the approach to ontology matching is meticulously strategised. The planning encompasses selecting appropriate algorithms and methods, fine-tuning parameters, determining thresholds for similarity and identity functions, and setting evaluative criteria. These preparations are informed by a thorough understanding of the project’s requirements and the outcomes of previous reuse evaluations. Numerous well-established ontology matching algorithms have been extensively reviewed in the literature (for in-depth discussions, see paper). The main classes of ontology matching techniques are listed below in the order of their relevance to this handbook: Terminological techniques draw on the textual content within ontologies, such as entity labels and comments, employing methods from natural language processing and information retrieval, including string distances and statistical text analysis. Structural techniques analyse the relationships and constraints between ontology entities, using methods like graph matching to explore the topology of ontology structures. Semantic techniques apply formal logic and inference to deduce the implications of proposed alignments, aiding in the expansion of alignments or detection of conflicts. Extensional techniques compare entity sets, or instances, potentially involving analysis of shared resources across ontologies to establish similarity measures. Following planning, the execution activity implements the chosen matchers. Automated or semi-automated tools are deployed to carry out the matching process, resulting in a list of candidate correspondences. This list typically includes suggested links between elements of the source and target ontologies, each with an associated confidence level computed by the algorithms. EDOAL, a representation framework for expressing such correspondences, is commonly utilised to encapsulate these potential alignments. Finally, in the evaluation activity, the candidate correspondences are rigorously assessed for their suitability. The evaluation measures the candidates against the project’s specific needs, scrutinising their accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the predefined requirements. This assessment ensures that only the most suitable correspondences are carried forward for the creation of an alignment, thereby upholding the integrity and logical soundness of the mapping process. Tools: Tools such as Silk can be used in this stage. Inputs: Matcher configurations, additional resources (if any), candidate correspondences from previous matching iterations. Outputs: Generated candidate correspondences, evaluation reports, finalised list of potential alignments. Following the identification of suitable matches, this step involves the formal creation of the alignment and the rendering (generation) of specific mappings between the source and target models. This phase encompasses preparation, creation, and rendering activities that solidify the relationships between ontology entities into a coherent alignment and actionable mappings. The resulting alignment is then documented, detailing the rationale, methods used, and any assumptions made during the mapping process. The alignment process should be considered as part of the governance of a vocabulary or ontology that would include engaging communication with third parties to validate the alignment. Furthermore, the process has technical implications that should be evaluated upfront such as the machine interpretation and execution of the mapping. Preparation involves stakeholder consensus on the Alignment Plan. This plan guides stakeholders through the systematic refinement of candidate correspondences, considering not only the relevance of the matches, but also the type of relationship between the elements. This plan might include the removal of irrelevant correspondences or strategic amendments to existing relationships. The chosen candidate correspondences are those that have been determined to be an adequate starting point for the alignment. The type of asset—be it an ontology, controlled list, or data shape—dictates the nature of the relationship that can be rendered from the alignment. The table [below] elucidates potential relationship types that can be established: Relation / Element type Property Concept Class Individual = owl:equivalentProperty; owl:sameAs skos:exactMatch; skos:closeMatch owl:equivalentClass; owl:sameAs owl:sameAs > skos:narrowMatch < rdfs:subPropertyOf skos:broadMatch rdfs:subClassOf % owl:propertyDisjointWith owl:disjointWith owl:differentFrom instanceOf rdf:type skos:broadMatch; rdf:type rdf:type rdf:type hasInstance skos:narrowMatch This table is indicative of the variety of semantic connections that can be realised, ranging from equivalence and subclass relations to disjointness and type instantiation. This nuanced approach to the preparation stage is essential in ensuring that the eventual alignment and rendered mapping accurately represent the semantic intricacies of the relationships defined in the project scope, thereby fulfilling the project’s defined requirements. The Creation step is the execution of the Alignment Plan, entailing the selection and refinement of correspondences. This activity involves human intervention to select and refine those correspondences for transitioning into a deliberate alignment. The selection is conducted manually according to the project’s objectives. Rendering translates the refined alignment into a mapping—a directed version that can be interpreted and executed by software agents. This process is straightforward, producing a machine-executable artefact. Most often this is a simple export of the alignment statements from the editing tool or the materialisation of the alignment in a triple store. Multiple renderings may be created from the same alignment, accommodating the need for various formalisms. Tools: Tools such as VocBench3 can be used in this stage, but more generic ones, such as MS Excel or Google Sheets spreadsheets, can be used as well. Inputs: Evaluated candidate correspondences, stakeholders' amendment plans, requirements for the formalism of the mapping. Outputs: Created alignment and mapping, alignment amendment strategy, stored versions in an alignment repository. The final stage focuses on operationalising the created alignment, ensuring it is accessible and usable by applications that require semantic interoperability between the mapped models. This involves publishing the alignment in a standardised, machine-readable format and integrating it within ontology management or data integration tools. Additionally, mechanisms for maintaining, updating, and governing the alignment are established, facilitating its long-term utility and relevance. Moreover, this stage involves the creation of maintenance protocols to preserve the alignment’s relevance over time. This includes procedures for regular updates in response to changes in ontology structures or evolving requirements, as well as governance mechanisms to oversee these adaptations. As the mapping is applied, new insights may emerge, prompting discussions within the stakeholder community about potential refinements or the development of a new iteration of the mapping. The dynamic nature of data sources means that the application stage is both an endpoint, as well as a starting point for continuous improvement. Some processes may be automated to enhance efficiency, such as the monitoring of ontologies for changes that would necessitate updates to the mapping. Inputs: Finalised mappings, application context, feedback mechanisms. Outputs: Applied mappings in use, insights from application, triggers for potential updates, governance actions for lifecycle management.

Creating semantic data specifications using this approach will support better interoperability. Example: The eProcurement Ontology [epo] is a domain-specific semantic data specification built by reusing terms from multiple Core Vocabularies. Note: Recommendation on how to address this use case can be found in the Clarification on “reuse” section of the SEMIC Style Guide, and therefore will not be addressed in this handbook. Use Case UC3.1: Create a new Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a new Core Vocabulary that reuses terms from other Core Vocabularies. Primary Actor: Semantic Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new Core Vocabulary that represents the concepts of a generic domain of high potential reusability, while reusing terms from existing CVs as much as possible for concepts that are already covered by those CVs.

Primary Actor: Semantic Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new data model artefact that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, describing the concepts that are relevant in a particular domain or application context, while reusing terms from existing CVs as much as possible. Such an artefact can be of different nature both according to their interoperability layer (ranging from vocabulary and ontology, to data shape and data schema) and also according to their abstraction level (ranging from upper layer, through domain layer to application layer). Note: Since this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into more concrete use cases that focus on specific data models. See also some related use cases (UC1, UC1.1 and UC1.2) discussed in the Addressed use cases section. Use Case UC4.1: Create a new ontology Goal: Create a new standalone ontology that reuses terms from Core Vocabularies.

Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping using Semantic Web technology (e.g. RML or other languages), to allow automated translation of JSON data conforming to a certain JSON schema, to RDF data expressed in terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. Such activity can be done by semantic engineers, based on input from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping is usually used as the basis for the formal mapping. The conceptual mapping can be a simple correspondence table associating the JSON data model elements defined in an JSON schema, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies.

Understanding this framework allows stakeholders to use the semantic data specifications effectively and align expectations and practices ensuring consistent and effective communication. The structure of the section is methodically organised into several subsections, each focusing on a different element of semantic data specifications. It begins with a broad overview of the specifications, and establishes what the artefacts are. Then progressively it narrows down to specific artefacts types, namely data models and documentation. Further subsections explore data models interaction across different layers of data interoperability, and semantic data specification types. This sequential approach helps readers build a comprehensive understanding from general concepts to specific explanations. Semantic data specifications are composite standards designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability among diverse systems, characterised by their descriptive and prescriptive nature. These specifications are realised through a suite of artefacts that are harmoniously interrelated and address different interoperability scopes and use cases—ranging from semantic to technical concerns. The artefacts are fashioned to be both machine-readable and human-understandable, ensuring consistent interpretation and utilisation. Figure 1 depicts a conceptualisation of how various components that make up a complete semantic data specification interconnect. At the top of the diagram is the \"Semantic data specification\" indicating its overarching role. It serves a \"Purpose/Goal\" which frames various specific \"Concern/Need\". The semantic data specification comprises various \"Artefacts\" denoting the different elements that make up the specification. Figure 1 Beneath this, the framework branches into two main types of artefacts: \"Data models” and \"Documentation\". The most relevant data models are \"Vocabulary\", \"Ontology\", \"Data shape\" and \"UML Class model\". Each data model is expressed in a \"Modelling language\" appropriate for the concern or the need addressed. The next section introduces the relevant artefact types. Integral to semantic data specifications is the intrinsic consistency and coherence among the artefacts. Each represents a facet of the same domain knowledge, but is tailored to address specific concerns—such as human understandability, semantic underpinning, formal definition, and data serialisation (addressed in the next section). This alignment ensures that each artefact, while distinct in function, contributes to a unified view of the domain, making the entire specification accessible and actionable. Such consistency is pivotal in maintaining semantic integrity, leading to robust technical interoperability and seamless information exchange. Each artefact, while unique in its form and function, represents different facets of the same domain. They are harmonised, yet distinct, with each created to address specific concerns, such as: Semantic Underpinning: The semantic data specification needs to encapsulate formally the domain knowledge, capturing the essence of its concepts and the possible relationships between them. Ontologies play a key role here, offering a structured and logical framework that lays out the domain knowledge in a way that is both comprehensive and actionable. Formal Definition: Using formal languages such as OWL or RDFS for semantic representation enables precise interpretation and inference over the ontologies and instance data. Moreover, data shapes facilitate data structuring on top of the ontology, defining precise constraints and conditions under which the data can be instantiated. This formalisation ensures that the data adheres to the standard, facilitating automated validation and processing. Human Understandability: This aspect ensures that individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, can comprehend and engage with the semantic data specifications. The reference documentation along with visual representation of UML class diagrams brings clarity and guidance for human users to grasp the meaning of the semantic data specification and its intended use. Visual Representation: The semantic data specification is much easier to understand once it is presented in a visual format. Typically class diagrams are the most suitable to encapsulate the concepts and the relations between boosting significantly comprehension. Data Serialisation: The technical artefacts of the specification, such as information exchange data models for various serialisation formats (e.g., JSON-LD, XML), ensure that the data can be correctly serialised, deserialized, and exchanged across systems and platforms. They cater for the technical requirements of data transport (and storage). The coherence among these artefacts ensures that despite their different purposes and audiences, they all align in their representation of the domain knowledge. This alignment guarantees that whether a stakeholder is interpreting the model conceptually, engaging with it through documentation, or implementing it technically, they are presented with a unified and consistent view of the semantic data specification. This cohesive approach is pivotal for maintaining semantic integrity across various applications and systems. The key data model artefacts of a specification include: Vocabulary: An established list of preferred terms that signify concepts or relationships within a domain of discourse. All terms must have an unambiguous and non-redundant definition. Optionally it may include synonyms, notes and their translation to multiple languages. It is represented informally, for example, as a spreadsheet or SKOS thesaurus. Ontology: An ontology is a formal, machine-readable specification of a conceptual model [Harpring2016]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming using URIs, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse, effectively enabling a shared and common understanding of data [wiki-onto]. It is usually expressed in OWL and RDFS. Data Shape: Constraints or patterns that describe how instantiations of an ontology should be structured. Data shape artefacts can be used not only to ensure that RDF data adheres to predefined structure and validation rules, but also as a blueprint for information exchange data models, preserving semantics and ensuring consistency in data exchange. It is usually expressed in SHACL. Controlled list (of values): A value vocabulary used to express concepts or values in instance data. It defines resources (such as instances of topics, languages, countries, or authors) that are used as values for elements in metadata records. Typically, the value vocabularies serve as reference data and constitute \"building blocks\" with which metadata records can be populated. UML class model: A static structure UML model and associated diagrams that describes the structure of data by showing the classes, their attributes, and the relationships among objects. It may include documentation, description and various annotations. Such data model shall be conformant to the SEMIC style guide in order to fit for purpose of semantic data specifications. Human-readable documentation: This artefact elucidates the specifications for stakeholders of varying business and technical backgrounds, detailing the structure, intent, and practical application of the semantic data specification. Beyond these foundational elements, semantic data specifications may also incorporate artefacts designed for the technical interoperability layer called information exchange data models. They define and describe in a technology-specific manner the structure and content of information that is exchanged between organisations in a specific information exchange context. They detail the syntax, structure, data types, and constraints necessary for effective data communication between systems. These artefacts are necessary to realise the technical interoperability. If the chosen technology for exchange is of semantic nature (e.g. RDF), then a perfect syntax-semantics conflation is readily available through ontologies and data shapes. Otherwise, if a more traditional technology is selected due to popularity or legacy reasons, such as XML/XSD or JSON, then a mapping that acts as a syntax-semantics interface needs to be established, binding the physical model and the semantic specification. These can include various information exchange data models like: JSON-LD context definitions: Facilitating the mapping of JSON to RDF linked data representation. XML Schemas (XSD): Defining the structure and validating the constraints of XML documents. API (Component) Specifications (REST, WSDL or GraphQL): Outlining the request, response and parameters for web-based data access and manipulation [swagger]. Such components are generally reusable blocks to facilitate reusability and maintenance of APIs. In the framework depicted [below], the artefacts are strategically organised within the semantic and technical interoperability layers, with each layer focusing on different but complementary aspects of data interoperability. As it can be seen, some artefacts belong to the semantic layer, and others to the technical layer, while the data shapes are present in both, according to their multipurpose nature. The Semantic Layer encapsulates artefacts associated with the conceptual understanding of data. It is focused on defining the vocabulary and ontology that provide the foundational elements for data interoperability. These artefacts ensure that the meaning of data is clearly defined and shared across different systems, establishing the semantic rules that govern data exchange. The Technical Layer is concerned with the practical aspects of data handling, such as data representation formats, communication protocols, and interface specifications. Artefacts in this layer address the technical requirements necessary for data to be physically exchanged and processed by information systems. Documentation and UML Class models are depicted as orthogonal to these layers, as they facilitate human understanding and transcend the semantic-technical divide. These artefacts provide clarity and guidance, helping stakeholders visualise and comprehend the data structures and relationships without being confined to the constraints of either layer. We can discern three interconnected layers each representing a different level of abstraction in semantic data specifications. The arrangement signifies the gradation from the abstract to the specific. The Upper Layer accommodates the most abstract form of semantic data specifications. These specifications are context-free, meaning that they are not tied to any particular domain or application, and can be universally applied across various fields. These semantic data specifications, provide the broadest concepts that can be reused in numerous contexts. Here we generally find upper level ontologies (defining highly abstract foundational concepts such as “object”, “property”, “event” etc.), but also the core semantic data specifications, which, although more specific, can also be applied across multiple domains. The main objective of the Core Vocabularies is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context [sem-sg-wsds]. Upper ontologies and core semantic data specifications serve as a scaffolding for domain ontologies, offering a hierarchy where the more general terms of the upper ontology act as superclasses (in some cases even as metaclasses) to the more specific classes of domain ontologies. This arrangement supports the structuring and integration of knowledge by providing common reference points that enhance understanding and data processing across different systems. Notable examples: Upper ontologies: DOLCE, Gist, BFO, etc. Core Vocabularies: Dublin Core Terms, Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), The Organization Ontology (ORG), European Legislation Identifier (ELI) The Domain Layer sits at the intersection of the upper and application layers. It contains specifications that are more specific than the upper layer, but not as narrowly focused as the application layer. The semantic data specifications in this layer incorporate concepts relevant to a domain or sector (e.g. the justice domain, the public procurement domain, the healthcare domain) and represent the most specific knowledge from the perspective of that domain. The domain layer is visually overlapped by both the upper and application layers, symbolising that some domain-specific semantic data specifications can inherit traits from, or lend characteristics to, both the more abstract upper layer and the more concrete application layer. Notable examples: DCAT-AP eProcurement Ontology The Application Layer is the most concrete and context-specific, containing semantic data specifications tailored for particular applications or families of applications. Application Profiles are detailed in constraints and data shapes, addressing explicit needs and constraints of a specific system or use case, and generally provide precise technical artefacts that can be used in data exchange. Notable examples: GeoDCAT-AP BRegDCAT-AP Stat-DCAT-AP Terminological Clarification: The level of abstraction pertaining to a semantic data specification—be it core, domain, or application—can be applied as an adjective to describe its constituent artefacts. Thus, for a \"core semantic data specification\" the included components would be referred to as \"core vocabulary\", \"core ontology\", \"core data shape\" and \"core exchange data model\" and so on. Similarly, for a \"domain semantic data specification,\" the elements would be denoted as \"domain vocabulary\", \"domain ontology\", \"domain data shape\" and \"domain exchange data model\", respectively. In the semantic data specification framework depicted [below], the documentation artefacts are organised into three distinct types, as illustrated in Figure 2, each catering to different aspects of user engagement with the data model. For effective documentation practices, we recommend principles laid out in the Diátaxis framework, which is a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users [dtx]. It identifies four distinct needs (learning, understanding, consulting reference, achieving goals), and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, handbooks, reference documentation and textbooks. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs. In addition, we mention the Diagrams, which are usually embedded into documents, to underline the importance of visual depiction of models and to recognise them as distinct artefacts from the models (e.g. UML class diagrams). In the context of semantic data specifications we find relevant the following documentation kinds. Figure 2 The Handbook (or usage manual) is a how-to guide and serves as an introductory reading to users new to the semantic data specification. It can also take the form of a tutorial to achieve predefined goals. It typically comprises use-case descriptions, examples and practical, step-by-step instructions designed to help users acquire the necessary skills to effectively use the semantic data specification. Examples: This document The Textbook (or explanatory manual) is an explanatory type of documentation and focuses on deepening the users’ understanding of the underlying concepts and principles incorporated into the semantic data specification. It aims to inform cognition, enhancing the user’s theoretical knowledge and conceptual insight, which is critical for those looking to gain a more profound grasp of the specification’s rationale, decisions, strengths and limitations. Examples: SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] The Reference document is a technical type of documentation and provides concise, detailed information about various elements of the semantic data specification. It serves users who are already familiar with the theoretical framework and need to apply their knowledge to specific tasks. This artefact is a go-to resource for factual and objective data about the semantic specifications, such as semantics, syntax, entities, properties, relationships, and constraints within the data model. Examples: reference documents for Core Person [cpv], Core Business [cbv], etc. These documentation artefacts are designed to collectively support the user’s journey from novice to expert within the semantic data specification domain. The Usage Manual aids in initial skill acquisition, the Explanatory Textbook supports deeper learning and understanding, and the Reference Documentation acts as a reliable resource for informed application and use. Together, they ensure that users at different stages of learning and practice have access to the appropriate materials to meet their needs.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"conceptual-framework","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/conceptual-framework.html","titles":[{"text":"Conceptual framework","hash":"_conceptual_framework","id":1},{"text":"Semantic data specifications","hash":"sec:semantic-data-specifications","id":2},{"text":"Artefacts","hash":"sec:artefacts","id":3},{"text":"Data models","hash":"sec:data-models","id":4},{"text":"Artefacts across interoperability layers","hash":"sec:artefacts-across-interoperability-layers","id":5},{"text":"Data specification types","hash":"sec:data-specification-types","id":6},{"text":"Documentation","hash":"sec:documentation","id":7}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"Creating an XSD schema for the Core Vocabulary involves defining the structure, data types, and relationships for the elements of the CBV, ensuring interoperability between systems. This tutorial follows the methodology outlined for Use Case UC1.1: \"Create a New XSD Schema,\" showing how to design and create an XSD schema that integrates terms from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). This step-by-step guide focuses on the essential stages of the schema creation process, ensuring that the elements from CBV are correctly imported, the document structure is shaped, and all constraints are applied. To recap the process, we first will import or define elements, shape the structure with patterns, define complex types, and finalise the schema. In XML schema development, managing imports and namespaces is crucial to ensure that elements from external vocabularies are reused and integrated consistently. This step ensures that the schema obtains semantics, will be reusable, and is correctly aligned with the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). For example, CBV comes with its own XSD schema, the following import statement imports all definitions related to CBV elements. The following example shows how to import the CBV into your XSD schema, which is explained afterward: : The element that imports the CBV schema to make its terms available in your schema. namespace=\"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/\": Defines the namespace of the CBV. schemaLocation=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/XML-schema/main/models/CoreVoc_Business/CoreVoc_Business.xsd\"\": Points to the location of the CBV schema file on the Web. If no XSD schema is provided by the Core Vocabulary, you must define these terms manually within your own schema. These new elements need to adhere to the Core Vocabulary’s namespace to maintain consistency. For example, the LegalEntity element could be defined as follows if no XSD is provided for it: Make sure you declare the correct namespace (e.g., http://example.com/) for all these custom elements. At this stage, we focus on structuring the XML document using appropriate XML Schema Design Patterns. The Venetian Blind and Garden of Eden patterns are two methods for organizing the schema. In the Venetian Blind pattern, there is one primary global element, and all other elements are nested inside it. This approach is ideal when a central entity, like LegalEntity, serves as the entry point, as seen in CBV. This pattern fits well with API design, where you typically request information about a central concept (such as LegalEntity), and the response includes nested elements like LegalName and RegisteredAddress, all organised under the main entity. Here’s an example, where LegalEntity serves as the main entry point: In this example: LegalEntity is the global entry point. It uses LegalEntityType, which contains various properties such as LegalName and RegisteredAddress. In the Garden of Eden pattern, there are multiple entry points in the XML document. This is more flexible and is suitable when no central class is inherently the main starting point.. Core Business Vocabularies (CBVs) often use this pattern. While LegalEntity may be central, the pattern allows reusing properties even if specific classes aren’t directly used. For example, you could start with a class like Identifier instead of LegalEntity. For instance, both LegalEntity and Organization can serve as root elements in the XML schema: After importing or defining the basic elements and structuring your XML document with patterns, the next step in creating an XSD schema is to define complex types. Complex types are used to represent business entities that contain multiple properties or relationships. For CBV, these types often model entities like LegalEntity or Organization, which have both simple and complex elements. For example, the LegalEntityType and OrganizationType, as follows. A LegalEntity might contain multiple child elements, such as LegalName modelled as a simple string, RegisteredAddress (also a complex type), and other related elements. Here’s how LegalEntityType is defined: Note: The sawsdl:modelReference annotation is used to link the element to an external concept, providing semantic context by associating the element with a specific vocabulary or ontology. Similar to the LegalEntityType complex type, the OrganizationType defines a business entity with multiple properties and relationships. However, for Organization, we define it as a complex type that contains hierarchical relationships, such as HeadOf and MemberOf. This allows Organization to contain members and potentially sub-organizations, thus creating a flexible representation of organizational structures. It’s important to note that in this context, LegalEntityType is defined as an extension of FormalOrganizationType, which, in turn, extends OrganizationType. Adding annotations and documentation to each complex type and element helps to clarify their purpose and improve the readability of the schema. For instance: A self-employed person, company, or organization that has legal rights and obligations. Finally, test your new schema by validating sample XML documents using XML validation tools (e.g.: XMLValidation tool) to ensure that the schema is syntactically correct and works as expected. The Core Business Vocabularies (CBV) follow several best practices and validation rules to maintain consistency, clarity, and reusability across schemas. These rules include naming conventions, documentation standards, and structural rules. To ensure schema compliance, the Schematron rules provide automated checks. These rules cover key aspects such as type definitions, element declarations, metadata, and more. The detailed list of rules can be found here. You can execute the rules using the provided build.xml file, which leverages Apache Ant. The process validates the schema against the Schematron rules and generates HTML reports for easy inspection.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"create xsd for cv","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/create%20xsd%20for%20cv.html","titles":[{"text":"UC1.1: Tutorial on creating an XSD schema for Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)","hash":"_uc1_1_tutorial_on_creating_an_xsd_schema_for_core_business_vocabulary_cbv","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1:Import or Define Elements","hash":"_phase_1import_or_define_elements","id":2},{"text":"Managing Imports and Namespaces","hash":"_managing_imports_and_namespaces","id":3},{"text":"Define elements","hash":"_define_elements","id":4},{"text":"Phase 2: Shape XML Document Structure with Patterns","hash":"_phase_2_shape_xml_document_structure_with_patterns","id":5},{"text":"Venetian Blind Pattern","hash":"_venetian_blind_pattern","id":6},{"text":"Garden of Eden Pattern","hash":"_garden_of_eden_pattern","id":7},{"text":"Define Complex Types","hash":"_define_complex_types","id":8},{"text":"Finalising the XSD Schema","hash":"_finalising_the_xsd_schema","id":9},{"text":"Phase 3: Validation and Best Practices","hash":"_phase_3_validation_and_best_practices","id":10},{"text":"Schematron Validation Rules","hash":"_schematron_validation_rules","id":11},{"text":"Running the Validation","hash":"_running_the_validation","id":12}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"Public administrations often need to share information about their services with other organisations and the public. To do this effectively, the data must be easy to understand and work seamlessly across different systems. However, public services are becoming more complex, which means we need to capture more details, concepts, and relationships to handle various use cases. The Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) provides a generic framework to describe public services in a machine-readable way. It helps public administrations share and organise information about services. However, sometimes CPSV-AP needs to be extended with new concepts or restrictions to address more general or specific use cases. For example, the terms Service and RequiredEvidence were introduced in CPSV-AP-NO to extend the CPSV-AP model such that it can fulfil the specific needs identified in Norway, where: Service allows for describing not only public services but also general ones, enabling the representation of services provided through partnerships or private organisations. RequiredEvidence provides a way to explicitly define the documentation or credentials needed to access a service, such as proof of address for health insurance registration. To make CPSV-AP more flexible and useful, creating a JSON-LD context is essential. JSON-LD helps structure the data so it can be easily shared and understood by different systems. This tutorial addresses the use case UC1.2, and will show how to create a JSON-LD context for an Application Profile that extends CPSV-AP with new concepts like Service and RequiredEvidence, which are defined by reusing concepts from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), following ideas from CPSV-AP-NO. By extending CPSV-AP and using JSON-LD, public administrations can better organise their data, making it easier to share and integrate across systems while supporting a wider range of use cases. Since CPSV-AP provides an existing JSON-LD context, we can import it in our own JSON-LD context using the @import statement. For example, in case of CPSV-AP version 3.2.0, the context can be directly reused like this: { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } } If a context that we can reuse does not exist, define the elements explicitly. For example, CPSV-AP uses specific terms such as PublicService and ContactPoint. These terms must be mapped to URIs. { \"@context\": { \"PublicService\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"ContactPoint\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/ContactPoint\" } } If a context needs to be extended, define the new elements explicitly. For example, if we need new terms (classes), such as Service and RequiredEvidence, which are not in CPSV-AP these terms must be mapped to URIs (the examples are inspired from CPSV-AP-NO) : { \"@context\": { \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"RequiredEvidence\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\" } } Once you’ve imported or defined the relevant terms, you need to structure your JSON-LD context to reflect the relationships between the classes and their properties. This allows you to describe public services and their details in a standardised and machine-readable format. Let’s look at an example where we define a Service and some of its key properties, such as contactPoint, description, name and hasRequiredEvidence. { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"Service.hasRequiredEvidence\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.description\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.name\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.contactPoint\": { \"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"@id\", \"@container\": \"@set\" } } } @context: Defines the mapping between terms (e.g., PublicService) and their corresponding IRIs. @container: Specifies how values are structured. For instance, @set: Explicitly defines a property as an array of values. It ensures that even if the data includes just one value, it will still be treated as an array by JSON-LD processors. This makes post-processing of JSON-LD documents easier as the data is always in array form, even if the array only contains a single value @id: Provides the unique identifier (IRI) for a term or property. @type: Specifies the type of a value. Commonly used for linking to classes or data types. @import: Imports another JSON-LD context, allowing reuse of its terms. After defining the context and structure, you can now describe an actual Service instance by referencing the terms you defined earlier. Let’s assume a public administration offers a service called \"Health Insurance Registration\". This service allows citizens to register for health insurance, which requires certain documents (evidence) to complete the process. Citizens might need to contact the administration for guidance, and the service details should be structured in a way that makes it easy to share and integrate across systems. To illustrate this, we’ve created a JSON-LD context representation of this service, highlighting The required evidence for registration (e.g., Proof of Address). The service’s name and description for clarity. Contact information for users who may need assistance. Try this in JSON-LD Playground here { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" } } When working with REST APIs, it is often beneficial to alias certain JSON-LD keywords for simpler or more consistent representations in client applications. For example, you might alias JSON-LD’s @id to url and @type to type to make the data more intuitive for API consumers, especially when working with legacy systems or client-side frameworks that use specific naming conventions. { \"@context\": { \"url\": \"@id\", \"type\": \"@type\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.name\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.description\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\" }, \"url\": \"http://example.com/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"type\": \"Service\", \"Service.name\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"Service.description\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\" } In this example: url is an alias for @id type is an alias for @type By aliasing these terms, the API responses are simplified and more familiar to the developers interacting with the service, especially if they are accustomed to a different JSON structure. To highlight the reuse of terms from existing CVs, we can import the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) context alongside the CPSV-AP context to gain access to business-related terms. This step ensures that you can use the additional terms from CBV, such as LegalEntity, Organisation, and ContactPoint, to enrich your Service descriptions. { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" }, { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\" } ] } Add CBV terms to enhance the description of the Service entity. { \"@context\": { \"Service.providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/legal#providedBy\", \"@type\": \"http://example.com/legal#LegalEntity\" }, \"LegalEntity\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity\" } } Use the extended properties to describe more aspects of Service instances. For example: { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\", { \"ex\": \"http://example.org/\" } ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"ex:providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.org/legalEntity/healthDepartment\", \"@type\": \"LegalEntity\" } } Use an online tool such as the JSON-LD Playground to validate JSON-LD context and make sure there are no errors. If the @import URLs for external contexts are incorrect or unavailable, the validation tool may display an error such as: \"Error loading remote context\" or \"Context could not be retrieved.\" { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://invalid-url/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } ] } These errors typically occur when the referenced context URL is malformed or unreachable, as shown in the following figure: Ensure that the @import URLs point to valid and accessible JSON-LD contexts. Verify the links in a browser or test them in a cURL command to ensure they return the correct JSON-LD data. Update the URLs to the correct ones.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"creating JSON-LD context (UC 1.2)","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/creating%20JSON-LD%20context%20(UC%201.2).html","titles":[{"text":"UC 1.2 tutorial on creating JSON-LD context","hash":"_uc_1_2_tutorial_on_creating_json_ld_context","id":1},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":2},{"text":"Steps to create a JSON-LD context","hash":"_steps_to_create_a_json_ld_context","id":3},{"text":"Import or define elements:","hash":"_import_or_define_elements","id":4},{"text":"Shape the structure","hash":"_shape_the_structure","id":5},{"text":"Explanation of JSON-LD keywords used","hash":"_explanation_of_json_ld_keywords_used","id":6},{"text":"Example of a simple service instance","hash":"_example_of_a_simple_service_instance","id":7},{"text":"Example scenario","hash":"_example_scenario","id":8},{"text":"Aliasing keywords for API compatibility (REST API example)","hash":"_aliasing_keywords_for_api_compatibility_rest_api_example","id":9},{"text":"Example of aliasing keywords","hash":"_example_of_aliasing_keywords","id":10},{"text":"Extend the context by reusing terms from Core Vocabularies","hash":"_extend_the_context_by_reusing_terms_from_core_vocabularies","id":11},{"text":"Define additional properties from the Core Business Vocabulary","hash":"_define_additional_properties_from_the_core_business_vocabulary","id":12},{"text":"Map extended properties in a service instance:","hash":"_map_extended_properties_in_a_service_instance","id":13},{"text":"Final review and validation","hash":"_final_review_and_validation","id":14},{"text":"Error example:","hash":"_error_example","id":15},{"text":"How to fix:","hash":"_how_to_fix","id":16}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"In the vast and diverse landscape of knowledge representation and data modelling, sources of knowledge are articulated through various means, each adopting its distinct methodology for expression. This diversity manifests not only in the choice of technology and representation languages, but also in the vocabularies used and the specific models created. Such heterogeneity, while enriching, introduces significant challenges for semantic interoperability—the ability of different systems to understand and use the information seamlessly across various contexts. The idea of unifying this rich spectrum of knowledge under a single model and a single representation language, though conceptually appealing, is pragmatically unfeasible and, arguably, undesirable. The diversity of knowledge sources is not merely a by-product of historical development, but a reflection of the varied domains, perspectives, and requirements these sources serve. To navigate this complexity, a more nuanced approach is required—one that seeks to establish connections across models without imposing uniformity. This is where the concepts of ontology matching and the broader spectrum of model alignment methodologies come into play. Moreover, the matching endeavour encompasses not only ontological artefacts, vocabularies and application profiles, but also various technical artefacts—ranging from data shapes defined in SHACL or ShEx, XSD schemas for XML, to JSON Schemas for JSON data. Each of these artefacts represents a different facet of information modelling and knowledge representation. Thus, mapping in this broader sense involves creating links between these semantic and technical artefacts and Core Vocabularies. The past couple decades have witnessed extensive efforts in ontology and attendant model matching, resulting in a plethora of tools, methods, and technologies aimed at enhancing semantic interoperability. These endeavours underscore the vast landscape of potential strategies available for matching. These strategies range from conceptual methodologies that explore the semantic congruence and contextual relevance of entities and relationships, to formal methodologies that operationalise these conceptual mappings as technical data transformation rules. It is important to acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all method; instead, the field offers a spectrum of approaches suited to various needs and contexts. The subsequent sections will describe the specific methodologies of matching—both conceptual and formal—and thereby providing a blueprint for navigating and bridging the world of semantic and technical artefacts, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions that best suit their interoperability needs.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"description-map-model","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/description-map-model.html","titles":[{"text":"How to map existing data models","hash":"_how_to_map_existing_data_models","id":1}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Alternative names: AP, context-specific semantic data specification Definition: Semantic data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context.

It serves as a practical blueprint for implementing an application profile in specific data exchange contexts. Additional information: An ontology and an exchange data model serve distinct yet complementary roles across different abstraction levels within data management systems. While a Data Schema specifies the technical structure for storing and exchanging data, primarily concerned with the syntactical and structural aspects of data, it is typically articulated using metamodel standards such as JSON Schema and XML Schema. In contrast, ontologies and data shapes operate at a higher conceptual level, outlining the knowledge and relational dynamics within a particular domain without delving into the specifics of data storage or structural implementations. Although a Data Schema can embody certain elements of an ontology or application profile—particularly attributes related to data structure and cardinalities necessary for data exchange—it does not encapsulate the complete semantics of the domain as expressed in an ontology. Thus, while exchange data models are essential for the technical realisation of data storage and exchange, they do not replace the broader, semantic understanding provided by ontologies. The interplay between these layers ensures that data schemas contribute to a holistic data management strategy by providing the necessary structure and constraints for data exchange, while ontologies offer the overarching semantic framework that guides the meaningful interpretation and utilisation of data across systems. Together, they facilitate a structured yet semantically rich data ecosystem conducive to advanced data interoperability and effective communication.

To create a new XSD schema, the following main steps need to be carried out: Import or define elements Shape structure with patterns Validation When working with XML schemas, particularly in relation to semantic artefacts like ontologies or data shapes, managing the imports and namespaces are vital considerations that ensure clarity, reusability, and proper integration of various data models. When a core vocabulary has defined an associated XSD schema, it is not only easy but also advisable to directly import this schema using the xsd:import statement. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the core vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. The imported elements are then employed in the definition of a specific document structure. For example, Core Vocabularies are based on DCTERMS, that provides an XML schema, so Core Person could import the DCTERMS XML schema for the usage of AgentType: In cases where the Core Vocabulary does not provide an XSD schema, it is necessary to create the XML element definitions in the new XSD schema corresponding to the reused URIs. Crucially, these new elements must adhere to the namespace defined by the Core Vocabulary to maintain consistency. For example “AgentType” must be defined within the “http://data.europa.eu/m8g/” namespace of the Core Vocabularies. Furthermore, when integrating these elements into a new schema, it is essential to reflect the constraints from the core vocabulary’s data shape—specifically, which properties are optional and which are mandatory–within the XSD schema element definitions. In designing XML schemas, the selection of a design pattern has implications for the reusability and extension of the schema. The Venetian Blind and Garden of Eden patterns stand out as preferable for their ability to allow complex types to be reused by different elements [sem-map]. The Venetian Blind pattern is characterised by having a single global element that serves as the entry point for the XML document, from which all the elements can be reached. This pattern implies a certain directionality and starting point, analogous to choosing a primary class in an ontology that has direct relationships to other classes, and from which one can navigate to the rest of the classes. Adopting Venetian Blind pattern reduces the variability in its application and deems the schema usable in specific scenarios by providing not only well-defined elements, but also a rigid and predictable structure. On the other hand, the Garden of Eden pattern allows for multiple global elements, providing various entry points into the XML document. This pattern accommodates ontologies where no single class is inherently central, mirroring the flexibility of graph representations in ontologies that do not have a strict hierarchical starting point. Adopting the Garden of Eden pattern provides a less constrained approach, enabling users to represent information starting from different elements that may hold significance in different contexts. This approach has been adopted by standardisation initiatives such as NIEM and UBL, which recommend such flexibility for broader applicability and ease of information representation. However, the Garden of Eden pattern does not lead to a schema that can be used in final application scenarios, because it does not ensure a single stable document structure but leaves the possibility for variations. This schema pattern requires an additional composition specification. For example, if it is used in a SOAP API, the developers can decide on using multiple starting points to facilitate exchange of granular messages specific per API endpoint. This way the XSD schema remains reusable for different API endpoints and even API implementations. Overall, the choice between these patterns should be informed by the intended use of the schema, the level of abstraction of the ontology it represents, and the needs of the end-users, aiming to strike a balance between structure and flexibility. Recommendation: We consider the Garden of Eden pattern suitable for designing XSD schemas at the level of core or domain semantic data specifications, and the Venetian Blind pattern suitable for XSD schemas at the level of specific Application Profiles.+ Recommendation for choosing the appropriate pattern: The Venetian Blind Pattern suits Application Profiles where a central entity is the main entry point, offering a structured schema for defined use cases. The Garden of Eden Pattern is better for Core or Domain Data Specifications, where multiple entry points provide flexibility for general-purpose data models. Complex types should be defined, if deemed necessary, only after importing or defining the basic elements and application of patterns. Complex types are deemed complex when they have multiple properties, be they attributes or relationships. Finally, complete the XSD schema by adding annotations and documentation using the `xs:annotation’ and `xs:documentation’ tags. This improves understanding of the schema’s content both for external users and oneself at a later date, as well as communicating the purpose so that the schema will be deployed as intended. The schema should be validated with at least one sample XML document, both to verify that it is syntactically correct and semantically as intended and has adequate coverage. SEMIC XSD schemas need to adhere to best practices and validation rules to maintain consistency, clarity, and reusability across schemas. These rules include naming conventions, documentation standards, and structural rules.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"guideline-create-xsd-for-cv","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/guideline-create-xsd-for-cv.html","titles":[{"text":"Guideline to Create a new XSD Schema","hash":"sec:create-a-new-xsd-schema","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1: Import or define elements","hash":"_phase_1_import_or_define_elements","id":2},{"text":"Phase 2: Shape XML document structure","hash":"_phase_2_shape_xml_document_structure","id":3},{"text":"Phase 3: Validation","hash":"_phase_3_validation","id":4}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC2.2. In order to create an XSD mapping one needs to decide on the purpose and level of specificity of the XSD schema mapping. It can range from producing a lightweight alignment at the level of vocabulary down to a fully fledged executable set of rules for data transformation. In this section we describe a methodology that covers both the conceptual mapping and the technical mapping for data transformation, and wrapping it up with validation and documentation. Figure 1 depicts a workflow to create an XSD schema mapping, which is segmented into five phases: Understand the XSD Schema and prepare test data, to ensure any preparations are completed before the mapping process; Create a Conceptual Mapping, so that business and domain experts can validate the correspondences It involves defining the correspondence between the XML elements from the XSD schema and the terms in the vocabulary; Create a Technical Mapping, so that the data can be automatically transformed. It involves converting the conceptual mappings into machine-executable transformation rules, focussing on the actual transformation of XML to RDF; Validate the mapping rules to ensure consistency and accuracy; Disseminate the documentation including, mainly, the used and generated files, mapping rules, and validation reports, to be applied in the foreseen use cases of the transformation pipelines. Figure 1. Workflow to create an XSD schema mapping Before initiating the mapping development process, it is crucial to construct a representative test dataset. This dataset should consist of a carefully selected set of XML files that cover the important scenarios and use cases encountered in the production data. It should be comprehensive yet sufficiently compact to facilitate rapid transformation cycles, enabling effective testing iterations in the validation phase. Also, it must align with the XSD schema for which it is test data. Conceptual Mapping in semantic data integration, i.e., regarding what from the source needs to map to what in the target, can be established at two distinct levels: the vocabulary level and the application profile level. These levels differ primarily in their complexity and specificity regarding the data context they address. We need to declare two mappings: regarding the vocabulary and the application profile. A Vocabulary mapping mapping is established using basic XML elements. This form of mapping aims at a terminological alignment, meaning that an XML element or attribute is directly mapped to an ontology class or property. For example, an XML element could be mapped to locn:Address class in a Core Vocabulary, or an element could be mapped to a property foaf:familyName in the FOAF ontology. Such mappings can be established and written in a simple spreadsheet. This approach results in a basic 1:1 direct alignment, which lacks contextual depth and specificity. A more advanced approach would be to embed semantic annotations into XSD schemas using standards such as SAWSDL. Such an approach is appropriate in the context of WSDL services. The Application Profile mapping of the conceptual mapping utilises XPath to guide access to data in XML tree structures, enabling precise extraction and contextualization of data before mapping it to specific ontology fragments. An ontology fragment is usually expressed as a SPARQL Property Path (or simply: a Property Path). This Property Path facilitates the description of instantiation patterns specific to the Application Profile. This advanced approach allows for context-sensitive semantic representations, crucial for accurately reflecting the nuances in interpreting the meaning of data structures. The tables below show two examples of mapping the organisation’s address, city and postal code. They show where the data can be extracted from, and how it can be mapped to targeted ontology properties such as locn:postName, and locn:postCode in the vocabulary. To ensure that this address is not mapped in a vacuum, but it is linked to an organisation instance, and not a person for example, the mapping is anchored in an instance ?this of an owl:Organisation. Optionally, a class path can be provided to complement the property path and explicitly state the class sequence, which otherwise can be deduced from the Application Profile definition.

Target Class Path org:Organization / locn:Address / rdf:PlainLiteral Inputs: XSD Schemas, Ontologies, SHACL Data Shapes, Source and Target Documentation, Sample XML data Outputs: Conceptual Mapping Spreadsheet The technical mapping step is a critical phase in the mapping process, serving as the bridge between conceptual design and practical, machine-executable implementation. This step takes as input the conceptual mapping, which has been crafted and validated by domain experts or data-savvy business stakeholders and establishes correspondences between XPath expressions and ontology fragments. When it comes to representing these mappings technically, several technology options are available (paper): such as XSLT, RML, SPARQLAnything, etc. But RDF Mapping Language (RML) stands out for its effectiveness and straightforward approach. RML allows for the representation of mappings from heterogeneous data formats like XML, JSON, relational databases and CSV into RDF, supporting the creation of semantically enriched data models. This code can be expressed in Turtle RML or the YARRRML dialect, a user-friendly text-based format based on YAML, making the mappings accessible to both machines and humans. RML is well-supported by robust implementations such as RMLMapper and RMLStreamer, which provide robust platforms for executing these mappings. RMLMapper is adept at handling batch processing of data, transforming large datasets efficiently. RMLStreamer excels in streaming data scenarios, where data needs to be processed in real-time, providing flexibility and scalability in dynamic environments. The development of the mapping rules is straightforward due to the conceptual mapping that is already available from Phase 2. Then, RML mapping statements are created for each class of the target ontology coupled with the property-object mapping statements specific to that class. Furthermore, it is essential to master RML along with XML technologies such as XSD, XPath, and XQuery to implement the mappings effectively (rml-gen). An additional step involves deciding on a URI creation policy and designing a uniform scheme for use in the generated data, ensuring consistency and coherence in the data output. A viable alternative to RML is XSLT technology, which offers a powerful, but low-level method for defining technical mappings. While this method allows for high expressiveness and complex transformations, it also increases the potential for errors due to its intricate syntax and operational complexity. This technology excels in scenarios requiring detailed manipulation and parameterization of XML documents, surpassing the capabilities of RML in terms of flexibility and depth of transformation rules that can be implemented. However, the detailed control it affords means that developers must have a high level of expertise in semantic technologies and exercise caution and precision to avoid common pitfalls associated with its use. A pertinent example of XSLT’s application is the tool for transforming ISO-19139 metadata to the DCAT-AP geospatial profile (GeoDCAT-AP) in the framework of INSPIRE and the EU ISA Programme. This XSLT script is configurable to accommodate transformation with various operational parameters such as the selection between core or extended GeoDCAT-AP profiles and specific spatial reference systems for geometry encoding, showcasing its utility in precise and tailored data manipulation tasks. Inputs: Conceptual Mapping spreadsheet, sample XML data Outputs: Technical Mapping source code, sample data transformed into RDF Given the output of Phase 3 and the test data preparation from Phase 1, first transform the sample XML data into RDF, which will be used for validation testing. Two primary methods of validation are employed to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data transformation: SPARQL-based validation and SHACL-based validation. They offer two fundamental methodologies for ensuring data integrity and conformity within semantic technologies, each serving distinct but complementary functions. The SPARQL-based validation method utilises SPARQL ASK queries, which are derived from the SPARQL Property Path expressions (and complementary Class paths) created as part of the conceptual mapping phase. These expressions serve as assertions that test specific conditions or patterns within the RDF data corresponding to each conceptual mapping rule. By executing these queries, it is possible to confirm whether certain data elements and relationships have been correctly instantiated according to the mapping rules. The ASK queries return a boolean value indicating whether the RDF data meets the conditions specified in the query, thus providing a straightforward mechanism for validation. This confirms that the conceptual mapping is implemented correctly in a technical mapping rule. For example, for the mapping rules above, the following assertions can be derived: ASK { ?this a org:Organization . ?this cv:registeredAddress / locn:postName ?value . } ASK { ?this a org:Organization . ?this cv:registeredAddress / locn:postCode ?value . } The SHACL-based validation method provides a more comprehensive framework for validating RDF data. In this approach, data shapes are defined according to the constraints and structures expected in the RDF output, as specified by the mapped Application Profile. These shapes act as templates that the RDF data must conform to, covering various aspects such as data types, relationships, cardinality, and more. A SHACL validation engine processes the RDF data against these shapes, identifying any deviations or errors that indicate non-conformity with the expected data model. SHACL is an ideal choice for ensuring adherence to broad data standards and interoperability requirements. This form of validation is independent of the manner in which data mappings are constructed, focusing instead on whether the data conforms to established semantic models at the end-state. It provides a high-level assurance that data structures and content meet the specifications designed to facilitate seamless data integration and interactions across various systems. Conversely, SPARQL-based validation is tightly linked to the mapping process itself, offering a granular, rule-by-rule validation that ensures each data transformation aligns precisely with the expert-validated mappings. It is particularly effective in confirming the accuracy of complex mappings and ensuring that the implemented data transformations faithfully reflect the intended semantic interpretations, thus providing a comprehensive check on the fidelity of the mapping process. Inputs: Sample data transformed into RDF, Conceptual Mapping, Technical Mapping, SHACL data shapes Outputs: Validation reports Once the conceptual and technical mappings have been completed and validated, they can be packaged for dissemination and deployment. The purpose of disseminating mapping packages are to facilitate their controlled use for data transformation, to ensure the ability to trace the evolution of mapping rules, and to standardise the exchange of such rules. This structured approach allows for efficient and reliable data transformation processes across different systems. A comprehensive mapping package typically includes: Conceptual Mapping Files: Serves as the core documentation, outlining the rationale and structure behind the mappings to ensure transparency and ease of understanding for both domain experts and engineers. Technical Mapping Files: This contains all the mapping code files ( XSLT, RML, SPARQLAnything etc., depending on the chosen mapping technology) for data transformation, allowing for the practical application of the conceptual designs. Additional Mapping Resources: Such as controlled lists, value mappings, or correspondence tables, which are crucial for the correct interpretation and application of the RML code. These should be stored in a dedicated resources subfolder. Test Data Sets: Carefully selected and representative XML files that cover various scenarios and cases. These test datasets are crucial for ensuring that the mappings perform as expected across a range of real-world data. Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) Reports: They document the testing outcomes based on the SPARQL and SHACL validations to guarantee that the mappings meet the expected standards before deployment. The generation of these reports should be supported by automation, as manual generation would involve too much effort and costs. Tests Used for FAT Reports: The package also incorporates the actual SPARQL assertions and SHACL shapes used in generating the FAT reports, providing a complete view of the validation process. Descriptive Metadata: Contains essential data about the mapping package, such as identification, title, description, and versions of the mapping, ontology, and source schemas. This metadata aids in the management and application of the package. This package is designed to be self-contained, ensuring that it can be immediately integrated and operational within various data transformation pipelines. The included components support not only the application, but also the governance of the mappings, ensuring they are maintained and utilised correctly in diverse IT environments. This systematic packaging addresses critical needs for usability, maintainability, and standardisation, which are essential for widespread adoption and operational success in data transformation initiatives.

Core Vocabularies Handbook 1.1. SEMIC Core Vocabularies 1.2. Conceptual framework 1.3. Use cases 1.4. How to create new data models 1.5. Glossary This Handbook aims to explain the role of Core Vocabularies in enabling semantic interoperability at the EU level and to practically guide public administrations in using Core Vocabularies to achieve this goal. This section introduces what interoperability is, what makes it semantic, and how Core Vocabularies contribute to it. This section contains a brief overview of the Core Vocabularies, indicating how they were developed and how they are maintained. Since 2011, the European Commission facilitates international working groups to forge consensus and maintain the SEMIC Core Vocabularies. A short description of these vocabularies is included in the Table below. The latest release of the Core Vocabularies can be retrieved via the SEMIC Support Center [semic] or directly from the GitHub repository [semic-gh]. Vocabulary Description The Core Person Vocabulary (CPV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a person; e.g., the name, gender, date of birth, and location. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing person-related information. The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity; e.g., the legal name, activity, and address. The Core Business Vocabulary includes a minimal number of classes and properties modelled to capture the typical details recorded by business registers. It facilitates information exchange between business registers despite differences in what they record and publish. The Core Location Vocabulary (CLV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. The Location Core Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a location represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. This specification enables interoperability among land registers and any other ICT based solution exchanging and processing location information. The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) supports the exchange of information between organisations that define criteria and organisations that respond to these criteria by means of evidence. The Core Evidence and Core Criterion Vocabulary (CCCEV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate development of interoperable information systems: the use of common vocabularies to describe criteria and evidence facilitates the development of information systems and improves their interoperability. Create a repository of reusable criteria in machine-readable formats: the use of common vocabularies promotes the creation of a repository of criteria and evidence information. Automate the assessment of criteria: the Core Vocabulary describing the criterion responses allows systems to easily compare the information collected from different parties and enables automatic assessment of the responses for a specific criterion. Automate scoring of responses: weighting criteria, the assessment can be followed by an automated scoring of the responses provided by different parties. Promote cross-border participation in public procurement: the use of the Core Vocabulary for electronic criterion and evidence allows for removing language barriers thereby improving the cross border exchange of information, and the cross-border participation in pan-European selection processes. Calculating statistics: standardising data for criterion, criterion responses and evidence allows calculating statistical information on the most commonly used criteria for a given process, the most relevant evidence, etc. Create a registry of mappings of criteria: using the Core Vocabulary, it is possible to create a registry of mappings to allow cross-checking of the criteria with the evidence of each particular Member State. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary provides a common data model for describing public organisations in the European Union. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary (CPOV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate information sharing: the CPOV enables G2G (Government-to-Government), G2B (Government-to-Business) and G2C (Government-to-Citizen) information sharing. Facilitate the development of common information systems: the use of existing data models for the development of common information systems facilitates the development of those systems and improves their interoperability. Linked Open Organograms: the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary has the potential to link organograms to each other and to high-value data sets. Cross border information exchange: the CPOV allows the management of a cross-border repository of public services and organisations. Find a PO by its function: the public organisation portfolio facilitates discovery of which public authorities and departments are responsible for given areas of the public task. Increase efficiency: the CPOV helps to identify where responsibilities and functions are duplicated or overlap. The Core Public Event Vocabulary (CPEV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a public event, e.g. the title, the date, the location, the organiser etc. The Core Public Event Vocabulary aspires to become a common data model for describing public events (conferences, summits, etc.) in the European Union. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing information related to public events. The Core Vocabularies are semantic data specifications that are disseminated as the following artefacts: lightweight ontology [sem-sg-wio] for vocabulary definition expressed in OWL [owl2]; loose data shape specification [sem-sg-wds] expressed in SHACL [shacl]; human-readable reference documentation [sem-sg-wdsd] in HTML (based on ReSpec [respec]); JSON-LD [w3c] context definitions [json-ld]; conceptual model specification [sem-sg-wcm] expressed in UML [uml]. The Core Vocabularies are published under the CC-BY 4.0 licence [cc-by]. The Core Vocabularies have been developed following the ‘Process and methodology for developing Core Vocabularies’ [cv-met], which has an open change and release management process , supported by SEMIC, that ensures continuous improvement and relevance to evolving user needs. This process begins with the identification of needs from stakeholders or issues raised in existing implementations. The Working Group members, SEMIC team or community of users propose changes that are thoroughly assessed for their impact and feasibility. Once a change is deemed necessary, it undergoes a drafting phase where the technical details are fleshed out, followed by public consultations to gather wider input and ensure transparency. Following consultations, the changes are refined and prepared for implementation. This stage may involve further iteration based on feedback or additional insights from ongoing discussions. The finalised changes are then formally approved and documented, ensuring they are well-understood and agreed upon by all relevant parties. The release management of Core Vocabularies follows a structured timeline that includes pre-announced releases and public consultation periods to allow users to prepare for changes. Each release includes detailed documentation to support implementation, ensuring users can integrate new versions with minimal disruption. This process not only maintains the quality and relevance of the Core Vocabularies, but also supports a dynamic and responsive framework for semantic interoperability within digital public services. Claiming conformance to Core Vocabularies is an integral part of validating (a) how well a new or a mapped data model or semantic data specification aligns with the principles and practices established in the SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] and (b) to what degree the Core Vocabularies are reused (fully or partially) [sem-sg-reuse]. The conformance assessment is voluntary, and shall be published as a self-conformance statement. This statement must assert which requirements are met by the data model or semantic specification. The conformance statement highlights various levels of adherence, ranging from basic implementation to more complex semantic representations. At the basic level, conformance might simply involve ensuring that data usage is consistent with the terms (and structure, but no formal semantics) defined by the Core Vocabularies. Moving to a more advanced level of conformance, data may be easily transformed into formats like RDF or JSON-LD, which are conducive to richer semantic processing and integration. This level of conformance signifies a deeper integration of the Core Vocabularies, facilitating a more robust semantic interoperability across systems. Ultimately, the highest level of conformance is achieved when the data is represented in RDF and fully leverages the semantic capabilities of the Core Vocabularies. This includes using a range of semantic technologies, adhering to the SEMIC Style Guide, fully reusing the Core Vocabularies, and respecting the associated data shapes. This section delves into the conceptual framework of semantic data specifications. Understanding this framework allows stakeholders to use the semantic data specifications effectively and align expectations and practices ensuring consistent and effective communication. The structure of the section is methodically organised into several subsections, each focusing on a different element of semantic data specifications. It begins with a broad overview of the specifications, and establishes what the artefacts are. Then progressively it narrows down to specific artefacts types, namely data models and documentation. Further subsections explore data models interaction across different layers of data interoperability, and semantic data specification types. This sequential approach helps readers build a comprehensive understanding from general concepts to specific explanations. Semantic data specifications are composite standards designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability among diverse systems, characterised by their descriptive and prescriptive nature. These specifications are realised through a suite of artefacts that are harmoniously interrelated and address different interoperability scopes and use cases—ranging from semantic to technical concerns. The artefacts are fashioned to be both machine-readable and human-understandable, ensuring consistent interpretation and utilisation. Figure 1 depicts a conceptualisation of how various components that make up a complete semantic data specification interconnect. At the top of the diagram is the \"Semantic data specification\" indicating its overarching role. It serves a \"Purpose/Goal\" which frames various specific \"Concern/Need\". The semantic data specification comprises various \"Artefacts\" denoting the different elements that make up the specification. Figure 1 Beneath this, the framework branches into two main types of artefacts: \"Data models” and \"Documentation\". The most relevant data models are \"Vocabulary\", \"Ontology\", \"Data shape\" and \"UML Class model\". Each data model is expressed in a \"Modelling language\" appropriate for the concern or the need addressed. The next section introduces the relevant artefact types. Integral to semantic data specifications is the intrinsic consistency and coherence among the artefacts. Each represents a facet of the same domain knowledge, but is tailored to address specific concerns—such as human understandability, semantic underpinning, formal definition, and data serialisation (addressed in the next section). This alignment ensures that each artefact, while distinct in function, contributes to a unified view of the domain, making the entire specification accessible and actionable. Such consistency is pivotal in maintaining semantic integrity, leading to robust technical interoperability and seamless information exchange. Each artefact, while unique in its form and function, represents different facets of the same domain. They are harmonised, yet distinct, with each created to address specific concerns, such as: Semantic Underpinning: The semantic data specification needs to encapsulate formally the domain knowledge, capturing the essence of its concepts and the possible relationships between them. Ontologies play a key role here, offering a structured and logical framework that lays out the domain knowledge in a way that is both comprehensive and actionable. Formal Definition: Using formal languages such as OWL or RDFS for semantic representation enables precise interpretation and inference over the ontologies and instance data. Moreover, data shapes facilitate data structuring on top of the ontology, defining precise constraints and conditions under which the data can be instantiated. This formalisation ensures that the data adheres to the standard, facilitating automated validation and processing. Human Understandability: This aspect ensures that individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, can comprehend and engage with the semantic data specifications. The reference documentation along with visual representation of UML class diagrams brings clarity and guidance for human users to grasp the meaning of the semantic data specification and its intended use. Visual Representation: The semantic data specification is much easier to understand once it is presented in a visual format. Typically class diagrams are the most suitable to encapsulate the concepts and the relations between boosting significantly comprehension. Data Serialisation: The technical artefacts of the specification, such as information exchange data models for various serialisation formats (e.g., JSON-LD, XML), ensure that the data can be correctly serialised, deserialized, and exchanged across systems and platforms. They cater for the technical requirements of data transport (and storage). The coherence among these artefacts ensures that despite their different purposes and audiences, they all align in their representation of the domain knowledge. This alignment guarantees that whether a stakeholder is interpreting the model conceptually, engaging with it through documentation, or implementing it technically, they are presented with a unified and consistent view of the semantic data specification. This cohesive approach is pivotal for maintaining semantic integrity across various applications and systems. The key data model artefacts of a specification include: Vocabulary: An established list of preferred terms that signify concepts or relationships within a domain of discourse. All terms must have an unambiguous and non-redundant definition. Optionally it may include synonyms, notes and their translation to multiple languages. It is represented informally, for example, as a spreadsheet or SKOS thesaurus. Ontology: An ontology is a formal, machine-readable specification of a conceptual model [Harpring2016]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming using URIs, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse, effectively enabling a shared and common understanding of data [wiki-onto]. It is usually expressed in OWL and RDFS. Data Shape: Constraints or patterns that describe how instantiations of an ontology should be structured. Data shape artefacts can be used not only to ensure that RDF data adheres to predefined structure and validation rules, but also as a blueprint for information exchange data models, preserving semantics and ensuring consistency in data exchange. It is usually expressed in SHACL. Controlled list (of values): A value vocabulary used to express concepts or values in instance data. It defines resources (such as instances of topics, languages, countries, or authors) that are used as values for elements in metadata records. Typically, the value vocabularies serve as reference data and constitute \"building blocks\" with which metadata records can be populated. UML class model: A static structure UML model and associated diagrams that describes the structure of data by showing the classes, their attributes, and the relationships among objects. It may include documentation, description and various annotations. Such data model shall be conformant to the SEMIC style guide in order to fit for purpose of semantic data specifications. Human-readable documentation: This artefact elucidates the specifications for stakeholders of varying business and technical backgrounds, detailing the structure, intent, and practical application of the semantic data specification. Beyond these foundational elements, semantic data specifications may also incorporate artefacts designed for the technical interoperability layer called information exchange data models. They define and describe in a technology-specific manner the structure and content of information that is exchanged between organisations in a specific information exchange context. They detail the syntax, structure, data types, and constraints necessary for effective data communication between systems. These artefacts are necessary to realise the technical interoperability. If the chosen technology for exchange is of semantic nature (e.g. RDF), then a perfect syntax-semantics conflation is readily available through ontologies and data shapes. Otherwise, if a more traditional technology is selected due to popularity or legacy reasons, such as XML/XSD or JSON, then a mapping that acts as a syntax-semantics interface needs to be established, binding the physical model and the semantic specification. These can include various information exchange data models like: JSON-LD context definitions: Facilitating the mapping of JSON to RDF linked data representation. XML Schemas (XSD): Defining the structure and validating the constraints of XML documents. API (Component) Specifications (REST, WSDL or GraphQL): Outlining the request, response and parameters for web-based data access and manipulation [swagger]. Such components are generally reusable blocks to facilitate reusability and maintenance of APIs. In the framework depicted [below], the artefacts are strategically organised within the semantic and technical interoperability layers, with each layer focusing on different but complementary aspects of data interoperability. As it can be seen, some artefacts belong to the semantic layer, and others to the technical layer, while the data shapes are present in both, according to their multipurpose nature. The Semantic Layer encapsulates artefacts associated with the conceptual understanding of data. It is focused on defining the vocabulary and ontology that provide the foundational elements for data interoperability. These artefacts ensure that the meaning of data is clearly defined and shared across different systems, establishing the semantic rules that govern data exchange. The Technical Layer is concerned with the practical aspects of data handling, such as data representation formats, communication protocols, and interface specifications. Artefacts in this layer address the technical requirements necessary for data to be physically exchanged and processed by information systems. Documentation and UML Class models are depicted as orthogonal to these layers, as they facilitate human understanding and transcend the semantic-technical divide. These artefacts provide clarity and guidance, helping stakeholders visualise and comprehend the data structures and relationships without being confined to the constraints of either layer. We can discern three interconnected layers each representing a different level of abstraction in semantic data specifications. The arrangement signifies the gradation from the abstract to the specific. The Upper Layer accommodates the most abstract form of semantic data specifications. These specifications are context-free, meaning that they are not tied to any particular domain or application, and can be universally applied across various fields. These semantic data specifications, provide the broadest concepts that can be reused in numerous contexts. Here we generally find upper level ontologies (defining highly abstract foundational concepts such as “object”, “property”, “event” etc.), but also the core semantic data specifications, which, although more specific, can also be applied across multiple domains. The main objective of the Core Vocabularies is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context [sem-sg-wsds]. Upper ontologies and core semantic data specifications serve as a scaffolding for domain ontologies, offering a hierarchy where the more general terms of the upper ontology act as superclasses (in some cases even as metaclasses) to the more specific classes of domain ontologies. This arrangement supports the structuring and integration of knowledge by providing common reference points that enhance understanding and data processing across different systems. Notable examples: Upper ontologies: DOLCE, Gist, BFO, etc. Core Vocabularies: Dublin Core Terms, Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), The Organization Ontology (ORG), European Legislation Identifier (ELI) The Domain Layer sits at the intersection of the upper and application layers. It contains specifications that are more specific than the upper layer, but not as narrowly focused as the application layer. The semantic data specifications in this layer incorporate concepts relevant to a domain or sector (e.g. the justice domain, the public procurement domain, the healthcare domain) and represent the most specific knowledge from the perspective of that domain. The domain layer is visually overlapped by both the upper and application layers, symbolising that some domain-specific semantic data specifications can inherit traits from, or lend characteristics to, both the more abstract upper layer and the more concrete application layer. Notable examples: DCAT-AP eProcurement Ontology The Application Layer is the most concrete and context-specific, containing semantic data specifications tailored for particular applications or families of applications. Application Profiles are detailed in constraints and data shapes, addressing explicit needs and constraints of a specific system or use case, and generally provide precise technical artefacts that can be used in data exchange. Notable examples: GeoDCAT-AP BRegDCAT-AP Stat-DCAT-AP Terminological Clarification: The level of abstraction pertaining to a semantic data specification—be it core, domain, or application—can be applied as an adjective to describe its constituent artefacts. Thus, for a \"core semantic data specification\" the included components would be referred to as \"core vocabulary\", \"core ontology\", \"core data shape\" and \"core exchange data model\" and so on. Similarly, for a \"domain semantic data specification,\" the elements would be denoted as \"domain vocabulary\", \"domain ontology\", \"domain data shape\" and \"domain exchange data model\", respectively. In the semantic data specification framework depicted [below], the documentation artefacts are organised into three distinct types, as illustrated in Figure 2, each catering to different aspects of user engagement with the data model. For effective documentation practices, we recommend principles laid out in the Diátaxis framework, which is a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users [dtx]. It identifies four distinct needs (learning, understanding, consulting reference, achieving goals), and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, handbooks, reference documentation and textbooks. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs. In addition, we mention the Diagrams, which are usually embedded into documents, to underline the importance of visual depiction of models and to recognise them as distinct artefacts from the models (e.g. UML class diagrams). In the context of semantic data specifications we find relevant the following documentation kinds. Figure 2 The Handbook (or usage manual) is a how-to guide and serves as an introductory reading to users new to the semantic data specification. It can also take the form of a tutorial to achieve predefined goals. It typically comprises use-case descriptions, examples and practical, step-by-step instructions designed to help users acquire the necessary skills to effectively use the semantic data specification. Examples: This document The Textbook (or explanatory manual) is an explanatory type of documentation and focuses on deepening the users’ understanding of the underlying concepts and principles incorporated into the semantic data specification. It aims to inform cognition, enhancing the user’s theoretical knowledge and conceptual insight, which is critical for those looking to gain a more profound grasp of the specification’s rationale, decisions, strengths and limitations. Examples: SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] The Reference document is a technical type of documentation and provides concise, detailed information about various elements of the semantic data specification. It serves users who are already familiar with the theoretical framework and need to apply their knowledge to specific tasks. This artefact is a go-to resource for factual and objective data about the semantic specifications, such as semantics, syntax, entities, properties, relationships, and constraints within the data model. Examples: reference documents for Core Person [cpv], Core Business [cbv], etc. These documentation artefacts are designed to collectively support the user’s journey from novice to expert within the semantic data specification domain. The Usage Manual aids in initial skill acquisition, the Explanatory Textbook supports deeper learning and understanding, and the Reference Documentation acts as a reliable resource for informed application and use. Together, they ensure that users at different stages of learning and practice have access to the appropriate materials to meet their needs. This handbook serves as a practical guide for using Core Vocabularies in various common situations. To provide clear and actionable insights, we have categorized potential use cases into two groups: Primary Use Cases: These are the most common, interesting, and/or challenging scenarios, all thoroughly covered within this handbook. Additional Use Cases: These briefly introduce other relevant scenarios but are not elaborated on in detail in this handbook. Within both groups, we differentiate between use cases focused on the creation of NEW artefacts and those involving the mapping of EXISTING artefacts to Core Vocabularies. For a better overview, we numbered the use cases and organised them into two diagrams, followed by the description of these use cases in two separate subsections, one dedicated to the addressed use cases and one to the use cases that are not addressed in this handbook. The use cases provided in this handbook are written in white-box point of style oriented towards user goals following the classification of [Cockburn99]. We will use the following template to describe the relevant use cases: Use Case : Title of the use case Goal: A succinct sentence describing the goal of the use case Primary Actor: The primary actor or actors of this use case Actors: (Optional) Other actors involved in the use case Description: Short description of the use case providing relevant information for its understanding Example: An example to illustrate the application of this use case Note: (Optional) notes about this use case, especially related to its coverage in this handbook Use Case UC1: Create a new information exchange data model Goal: Create a new standalone data schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. Note: As this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data formats. Use Case UC1.1: Create a new XSD schema Goal: Create a new standalone XSD schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new XSD schema that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, an XSD Schema can be used to create and validate XML data to be exchanged between information systems. Example: OOTS XML schema mappings [oots] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Create a new XSD schema Use Case UC1.2: Create a new JSON-LD context definition Goal: Create a new standalone JSON-LD context definition that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new JSON-LD context definition that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, a JSON-LD context definition can be integrated in describing data, building APIs, and other operations involved in information exchange. Example: Core Person Vocabulary [cpv-json-ld], Core Business Vocabulary [cbv-json-ld] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for use cases will be provided in the Create a new JSON-LD context definition section. Use Case UC2: Map an existing data model to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping of an existing (information exchange) data model, to terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a mapping of an ontology, vocabulary, or some kind of data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, to terms from CVs. Such a mapping can be done at a conceptual level, or formally, e.g. in the form of transformation rules, and most often will include both. Note: Since this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data models and/or data formats. Some of those use cases will be described in detail below, while others will be included in the Appendix, which is dedicated to the additional use cases. Use Case UC2.1: Map an existing Ontology to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping between the terms of an existing ontology and the terms of Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping expressed in Semantic Web terminology (for example using rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, owl:sameAs properties), associating the terms in an existing ontology that defines relevant concepts in a given domain, to terms defined in one or more CVs. This activity is usually performed by a semantic engineer based on input received from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping associates the terms in an existing ontology, which defines relevant concepts within a specific domain, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. The result of the formal mapping can be used later by software engineers to build information exchange systems. Example: Mapping Core Person to Schema.org [map-cp2org], Core Business to Schema.org [map-cb2org], etc. Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing Model section. Use Case UC2.2: Map an existing XSD Schema to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Define the data transformation rules for the mapping of an XSD schema to terms from Core Vocabularies. Create a mapping of XML data that conforms to an existing XSD schema to an RDF representation that conforms to a Core Vocabulary for formal data transformation. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. RML or other languages), to allow automated translation of XML data conforming to a certain XSD schema, to RDF data expressed in terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. This use case required definitions of an Application Profile for a Core Vocabulary because the CV alone does not specify sufficient instantiation constraints to be precisely mappable. Such activity can be done by semantic engineers based on input from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping is usually used as the basis for the formal mapping. The conceptual mapping can be a simple correspondence table associating the XML Elements defined in an XSD schema, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. In some cases the creation of the conceptual mapping can be done by the semantic engineers themselves, or even by the software engineers building information exchange systems. Example: ISA2core SAWSDL mapping [isa2-map] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing XSD schema section. The additional use cases are described in the Appendix. This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC1.1. To create a new XSD schema, the following steps need to be observed: Import or define elements Shape structure with patterns When working with XML schemas, particularly in relation to semantic artefacts like ontologies or data shapes, managing the imports and namespaces are vital considerations that ensure clarity, reusability, and proper integration of various data models. When a core vocabulary has defined an associated XSD schema, it is not only easy but also advisable to directly import this schema using the xsd:import statement. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the core vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. The imported elements are then employed in the definition of a specific document structure. For example, Core Vocabularies are based on DCTERMS [ref], that provides an XML schema, so Core Person could import the DCTERMS XML schema for the usage of AgentType: In cases where the Core Vocabulary does not provide an XSD schema, it is necessary to create for the reused URIs the corresponding XML element definitions in the new XSD schema. Crucially, these new elements must adhere to the namespace defined by the Core Vocabulary to maintain consistency. For example “AgentType” must be defined within the “http://data.europa.eu/m8g/” namespace of the Core Vocabularies. Furthermore, when integrating these elements into a new schema, it is essential to reflect the constraints from the core vocabulary’s data shape-specifically, which properties are optional and which are mandatory - within the XSD schema element definitions. In designing XML schemas, the selection of a design pattern has implications for the reusability and extension of the schema. The Venetian Blind and Garden of Eden patterns stand out as preferable for their ability to allow complex types to be reused by different elements [sem-map]. The Venetian Blind pattern is characterised by having a single global element that serves as the entry point for the XML document, from which all the elements can be reached. This pattern implies a certain directionality and starting point, analogous to choosing a primary class in an ontology that has direct relationships to other classes, and from which one can navigate to the rest of the classes. For instance, in the Core Business Vocabulary, if one were to select the \"Legal Entity\" class as the starting point, it would shape the XML schema in such a way that all other classes could be reached from this entry point, reflecting its central role within the ontology. A possible implementation with Venetian Blind with “Legal Entity” as the root element would be: Adopting Venetian Blind pattern reduces the variability in its application and deems the schema usable in specific scenarios by providing not only well-defined elements, but also a rigid and predictable structure. On the other hand, the Garden of Eden pattern allows for multiple global elements, providing various entry points into the XML document. This pattern accommodates ontologies where no single class is inherently central, mirroring the flexibility of graph representations in ontologies that do not have a strict hierarchical starting point. Adopting the Garden of Eden pattern provides a less constrained approach, enabling users to represent information starting from different elements that may hold significance in different contexts. This approach has been adopted by standardisation initiatives such as NIEM and UBL, which recommend such flexibility for broader applicability and ease of information representation. However, the Garden of Eden pattern does not lead to a schema that can be used in final application scenarios, because it does not ensure a single stable document structure but leaves the possibility for variations. This schema pattern requires an additional composition specification. For example, if it is used in a SOAP API, the developers can decide on using multiple starting points to facilitate exchange of granular messages specific per API endpoint. This way the XSD schema remains reusable for different API endpoints and even API implementations. Overall, the choice between these patterns should be informed by the intended use of the schema, the level of abstraction of the ontology it represents, and the needs of the end-users, aiming to strike a balance between structure and flexibility. Recommendation: We consider the Garden of Eden pattern suitable for designing XSD schemas at the level of core or domain semantic data specifications, and the Venetian Blind pattern suitable for XSD schemas at the level of specific Application Profiles. This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC1.2. JSON-LD combines the simplicity, power, and web ubiquity of JSON with the concepts of Linked Data. Creating JSON-LD context definitions facilitates this synergy. This ensures that when data is shared or integrated across systems, it maintains its meaning and can be understood in the same way across different contexts. Here’s a guide on how to create new JSON-LD contexts for existing CVs, using the Core Person Vocabulary as an example. Import or define elements Shape structure When a CV has defined an associated JSON-LD context, it is not only easy, but also advisable to directly import this context using the @import keyword. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. \"@context\": {\"@import\": \"https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld\", } In cases where the CV does not provide an JSON-LD context, it is necessary to create for the reused URIs the corresponding field element definitions. To start, gather all the terms from the Core Person Vocabulary that you want to include in your JSON-LD context. Terms can include properties like given name, family name, date of birth, and relationships like residency or contact point. Then, decide the desired structure of the JSON-LD file, by defining the corresponding keys, for example Person.givenName, Person.familyName, Person.dateOfBirth, Person.residency, Person.contactPoint. These new fields must adhere to the naming defined by the CV to maintain consistency. Finally, assign URIs to keys. Each term in your JSON-LD context must be associated with a URI from an ontology that defines its meaning in a globally unambiguous way. Associate the URIs established in CVs to JSON keys using the same CV terms. For example: \"Person.contactPoint\": {\"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\"}. The ones that are imported by the CVs, shall be used as originally defined, for example from FOAF: \"Person.givenName\": {\"@id\": \"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName\"}. Start defining the structure of the context by relating class terms with property terms and then, if necessary, property terms with other classes. Commence by creating a JSON structure that starts with a @context field. This field will contain mappings from your vocabulary terms to their respective URIs. Continue by defining fields for Classes and subfields for their properties. If the JSON-LD context is developed with the aim of being used directly in exchange specific to an application scenario, then aim to establish a complete tree structure that starts with a single root class. To do so, specify precise @type references linking to the specific Class. For example: \"Person.contactPoint\" : {\"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"ContactPoint\"}. If the aim of the developed JSON-LD context is rather ensuring semantic correspondences, without any structural constraints, which is the case for core or domain semantic data specification, then definitions of structures specific to each entity type and its properties suffice, using only loose references to other objects. For example: \"Person.contactPoint\": {\"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"@id\"} Unresolved include directive in modules/ROOT/pages/handbook-as-a-whole.adoc - include::how-to-map-existing-data-models.adoc[] Alternative names: AP, context-specific semantic data specification Definition: Semantic data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context. Additional information: It re-uses concepts from one or more semantic data specifications, while adding more specificity, by identifying mandatory, recommended, and optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and providing recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Alternative names: conceptual model specification Definition: An abstract representation of a system that comprises well-defined concepts, their qualities or attributes, and their relationships to other concepts. Additional information: A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Alternative names: restriction, axiom, shape Definition: Restriction to which an entity or relation must adhere. Additional information: Models normally consist not only of the entity types and relationships between them, but also contain constraints that hold over them. The types of constraints that can be declared depend on the type of model. For instance, a SQL schema for a relational database has, among others, a data type constraint for each column specification and referential integrity constraints, a UML Class diagram has multiplicity constraints declared on an association to specify the amount of relations each instance is permitted to have, and an ontology may contain an axiom that declares an object property to be, e.g., symmetric or transitive. The list of permissible constraints typically is part of the modelling language, but it also may be an associated additional constraint language, such as SHACL for RDF and OCL for UML. Alternative names: CV Definition: A basic, reusable and extensible semantic data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Additional information: Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Definition: A structured representation of data elements and relationships used to facilitate semantic interoperability within and across domains. Additional information: Data models are represented in common languages to facilitate semantic interoperability in a data space, including ontologies, data models, schema specifications, mappings and API specifications that can be used to annotate and describe data sets and data services. They are often domain-specific. Source/Reference: Data Spaces Blueprint Alternative names: data schema Definition: Information exchange data model is a technology-specific framework for data exchange, detailing the syntax, structure, data types, and constraints necessary for effective data communication between systems. It serves as a practical blueprint for implementing an application profile in specific data exchange contexts. Additional information: An ontology and an exchange data model serve distinct yet complementary roles across different abstraction levels within data management systems. While a Data Schema specifies the technical structure for storing and exchanging data, primarily concerned with the syntactical and structural aspects of data, it is typically articulated using metamodel standards such as JSON Schema and XML Schema. In contrast, ontologies and data shapes operate at a higher conceptual level, outlining the knowledge and relational dynamics within a particular domain without delving into the specifics of data storage or structural implementations. Although a Data Schema can embody certain elements of an ontology or application profile—particularly attributes related to data structure and cardinalities necessary for data exchange—it does not encapsulate the complete semantics of the domain as expressed in an ontology. Thus, while exchange data models are essential for the technical realisation of data storage and exchange, they do not replace the broader, semantic understanding provided by ontologies. The interplay between these layers ensures that data schemas contribute to a holistic data management strategy by providing the necessary structure and constraints for data exchange, while ontologies offer the overarching semantic framework that guides the meaningful interpretation and utilisation of data across systems. Together, they facilitate a structured yet semantically rich data ecosystem conducive to advanced data interoperability and effective communication.

To create a new XSD schema, the following steps need to be observed: Import or define elements Shape structure with patterns When working with XML schemas, particularly in relation to semantic artefacts like ontologies or data shapes, managing the imports and namespaces are vital considerations that ensure clarity, reusability, and proper integration of various data models. When a core vocabulary has defined an associated XSD schema, it is not only easy but also advisable to directly import this schema using the xsd:import statement. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the core vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. The imported elements are then employed in the definition of a specific document structure. For example, Core Vocabularies are based on DCTERMS [ref], that provides an XML schema, so Core Person could import the DCTERMS XML schema for the usage of AgentType: In cases where the Core Vocabulary does not provide an XSD schema, it is necessary to create for the reused URIs the corresponding XML element definitions in the new XSD schema. Crucially, these new elements must adhere to the namespace defined by the Core Vocabulary to maintain consistency. For example “AgentType” must be defined within the “http://data.europa.eu/m8g/” namespace of the Core Vocabularies.

In this section we adopt the definitions from the ontology matching handbook EuzenatShvaiko13 for the following concepts: Ontology matching process: given a pair of ontologies, an input alignment, a set of parameters and a set of oracles and resources, the process returns an alignment between these ontologies Correspondence: given a pair of ontologies, a set of alignment relations (typically equivalence and subsumption) and a confidence structure for those alignments, then a correspondence is a 5-tuple consisting of an identifier of the correspondence, the two entities (one from each ontology), how the two entities relate, and a measure of the confidence in that alignment. Alignment: a set of correspondences between pairs of entities belonging to two ontologies. Mapping: a set of correspondences between pairs of entities belonging to two ontologies, and this mapping is satisfiable and does not lead to unsatisfiable entities in either of the two ontologies that are being matched. To create an ontology mapping, the following steps need to be observed: Staging: defining the requirements Characterisation: defining source and target data and performing data analysis Reuse: discover, evaluate, and reuse existing alignments Matching: execute and evaluate matching Align and map: prepare, create the alignment, and render mappings Validate: check whether the candidate alignments found are meaningful Application: publish the mappings and establish governance of the mappings This section provides an overview of the guideline, which will be demonstrated in the tutorial section where we map the Core Business Vocabulary to Schema.org. This initial phase involves a comprehensive understanding of the project’s scope, identifying the specific goals of the mapping exercise, and the key requirements it must fulfil. Stakeholders collaborate to articulate the purpose of the alignment between the models, setting clear objectives that will guide the process. Defining these requirements upfront ensures that subsequent steps are aligned with the model matching process’ overarching goals, stakeholder expectations, and fitting the use cases. Inputs: Stakeholder knowledge, project goals, available resources, domain expertise. Outputs: Mapping project specification document comprising a defined mapping project scope and comprehensive list of requirements. In this stage, a thorough analysis of both source and target ontologies is conducted to ascertain their structures, vocabularies, and the semantics they encapsulate. This involves an in-depth examination of the conceptual frameworks, data representation languages, and any existing constraints within both models. Understanding the nuances of both the source and target is critical for identifying potential challenges and opportunities in the matching process, ensuring that the process will be feasible and meaningful. The following is an indicative, but not exhaustive, list of aspects to consider in this analysis about the the two artefacts: specifications documentation, representation language and representation formats, deprecation mechanism, inheritance policy (single inheritance only or multiple inheritance are also allowed), natural language(s) used, label specification, label conventions, definition specification, definition conventions, and version management and release cycles. These features can have consequences for the mapping task. For instance, the files being available in the same format, such as both in JSON-LD, simplifies declaring and implementing the mappings technically, whereas if they are in a different format, one will have to be converted into the other format, if it is possible to do so without loss of meaning. The natural language of the ontology or vocabulary refers to the rendering of the entities’ names or labels, which may be one language, multiple languages equally, one language mainly and others with partial coverage. If the source and target are in a different natural language, the task is not simply one of mapping entities, but also translating names, labels, and annotations of entities. An infrequently updated version can indicate either that it is a stable release or that it is not maintained, and the comparison thus depends on a broader setting that may be worthwhile to ascertain. Conversely, a frequently updated version is less stable, and it may even be the case that by the time a matching process is completed with one version, a new version has been released that might require an update to the mapping. Depending on the feature, one will have to inspect either the computer-processable file or the dedicated documentation that describes it, or both. Inputs: Source and target ontologies, requirements, and any business or domain constraints. Outputs: Analysis reports comprising a comparative characterisation table, identified difficulties, risks and amenability assessments, selected source and target for mapping. In the ontology matching lifecycle, the reuse phase is pivotal, because it will facilitate the integration of already existing mappings into the project’s workflow, thereby saving work and positioning one’s ontology better within the extant ecosystem. Following the initial characterisation, this phase entails discovery and evaluation of available mappings against the project’s defined requirements. These requirements are instrumental in appraising whether an existing alignment can be directly adopted, necessitates modifications for reuse, or if a new alignment should be constructed from the ground up. Ontology alignments are often expressed in Alignment Format (AF) or EDOAL. The outcome of this activity can be either of: direct reuse of mappings that are immediately applicable, adaptive reuse where existing mappings provide a partial fit and serve as a basis for refinement of the mapping, and the initiation of a new alignment when existing resources are not suitable. This structured approach to reuse optimises resource utilisation, promotes efficiency, and tailors the mapping process to the project’s unique objectives. Inputs: repository of existing alignments for the source and target ontologies, evaluation criteria based on requirements. Outputs: Assessment report on existing alignments, decisions on reuse, adaptation, or creation of a new alignment. This section summarises automatic and semi-automatic approaches to finding the alignment candidates. In cases of small vocabularies and ontologies, a fully manual effort is likely more efficient. Utilising both automated tools and manual expertise, this phase focuses on identifying potential correspondences between entities in the source and target models. The matching process may employ various methodologies, including semantic similarity measures, pattern recognition, or lexical analysis, to propose candidate alignments. These candidates are then critically evaluated for their accuracy, relevance, and completeness, ensuring they meet the predefined requirements and are logically sound. This stage is delineated into three main activities: planning, execution, and evaluation. In the planning activity, the approach to ontology matching is meticulously strategised. The planning encompasses selecting appropriate methods with their algorithms and tools, fine-tuning parameters, determining thresholds for similarity and identity functions, and setting evaluative criteria. These preparations are informed by a thorough understanding of the project’s requirements and the outcomes of previous reuse evaluations. Numerous well-established ontology matching algorithms have been extensively reviewed in the literature (for a review and in-depth analysis, see OteraEtAl15, EuzenatShvaiko13). The main classes of ontology matching techniques are listed below in the order of their relevance to this handbook: Terminological techniques draw on the textual content within ontologies, such as entity labels and comments, employing methods from natural language processing and information retrieval, including string distances and statistical text analysis. Structural techniques analyse the relationships and constraints between ontology entities, using methods like graph matching to explore the topology of ontology structures. Semantic techniques apply formal logic and inference to deduce the implications of proposed alignments, aiding in the expansion of alignments or detection of conflicts. Extensional techniques compare entity sets, or instances, potentially involving analysis of shared resources across ontologies to establish similarity measures. Following planning, the execution activity implements the chosen matchers. Automated or semi-automated tools are deployed to carry out the matching process, resulting in a list of candidate correspondences. This list typically includes suggested links between elements of the source and target ontologies, each with an associated confidence level computed by the algorithms. EDOAL, a representation framework for expressing such correspondences, is commonly utilised to encapsulate these potential alignments. Finally, in the evaluation activity, the alignments found are rigorously assessed for their suitability. The evaluation measures the alignments against the project’s specific needs, scrutinising their accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the predefined requirements. This assessment ensures that only the most suitable alignments are carried forward for the creation of a mapping, thereby upholding the integrity and logical soundness of the matching process. Tools: Tools such as Silk, LIMES, and LogMap may be used in this stage. Inputs: Matcher configurations, additional resources (if any), correspondences from previous matching iterations. Outputs: Generated alignments, evaluation reports. Following the identification of alignments, this step involves the formal creation of the alignment and the rendering (generation) of specific mappings between the source and target models. This phase encompasses preparation, creation, and rendering activities that solidify the relationships between ontology entities into a coherent mapping that is actionable. The resulting alignment is then documented, detailing the rationale, methods used, and any assumptions made during the mapping process. The alignment process should be considered as part of the governance of a vocabulary or ontology that would include engaging communication with third parties to validate the alignment. Furthermore, the process has technical implications that should be evaluated upfront such as the machine interpretation and execution of the mapping. Preparation involves stakeholder involvement to collectively go systematically through the list of alignments (candidate mappings), considering not only the relevance of the alignments, but also the type of relationship between the elements, being typically either equivalence or subsumption. The type of asset—be it an ontology, controlled list, or data shape—dictates the nature of the relationship that can be rendered from the alignment. The table below lists possible types of alignment and mapping relationship types that can be established. Relation / Element type Property Concept Class Individual = owl:equivalentProperty; owl:sameAs skos:exactMatch; skos:closeMatch owl:equivalentClass; owl:sameAs owl:sameAs > skos:narrowMatch < rdfs:subPropertyOf skos:broadMatch rdfs:subClassOf % owl:propertyDisjointWith owl:disjointWith owl:differentFrom instanceOf rdf:type skos:broadMatch; rdf:type rdf:type rdf:type hasInstance skos:narrowMatch This table is indicative of the variety of semantic connections that can be realised, ranging from equivalence and subclass relations to disjointness and type instantiation. This nuanced approach to the preparation stage is essential in ensuring that the eventual alignment and rendered mapping accurately represent the semantic intricacies of the relationships defined in the project scope, thereby fulfilling the project’s defined requirements. The Creation step is the execution of the mapping, entailing the selection of the relation, and assertion of the mapping This activity involves human intervention and the selection is conducted manually according to the project’s objectives and semantic appropriateness of the candidate mapping. Rendering translates the mapping in a machine-readable format so that it can be interpreted and executed by software agents. Typically, this is a straight-forward export of the alignment statements from the editing tool or the materialisation of the mapping in a triple store, using a common format, such as Alignment Format, EDOAL, Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mapping SSSOM, and the Semantic Mapping Vocabulary SEMAPV for the mapping justification values. Multiple renderings may be created from the same alignment, accommodating the need for various formalisms. Tools: Tools such as VocBench3 can be used in this stage, or generic office tools if the stakeholders so prefer, such as MS Excel, Google Sheets spreadsheets, or a LibreOffice spreadsheet. Inputs: Evaluated correspondences (the alignments), stakeholders' amendment plans, requirements for the formalism of the mapping. Outputs: Created mapping, alignment amendment strategy, stored versions in an alignment repository. The final stage focuses on operationalising the created mappings, ensuring it is accessible and usable by applications that require semantic interoperability between the mapped models. This involves publishing the mappings in the standardised, machine-readable format obtained from Phase 5 and mechanisms for maintaining, updating, and governing the alignment are established, facilitating its long-term utility and relevance. The governance involves the creation of maintenance protocols to preserve the alignment’s relevance over time. This includes procedures for regular updates in response to changes in ontology structures or evolving requirements, as well as governance mechanisms to oversee these adaptations. As the mapping is applied, new insights may emerge, prompting discussions within the stakeholder community about potential refinements or the development of a new iteration of the mapping. The dynamic nature of data sources means that the application stage is both an endpoint, as well as a starting point for continuous improvement. Some processes may be automated to enhance efficiency, such as the monitoring of ontologies for changes that would necessitate updates to the mapping. Inputs: Finalised mappings, application context, feedback mechanisms. Outputs: Applied mappings in use, insights from application, triggers for potential updates, governance actions for lifecycle management.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"map-an-existing-model-guideline","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/map-an-existing-model-guideline.html","titles":[{"text":"Guidelines for how to map existing data models","hash":"_guidelines_for_how_to_map_existing_data_models","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1: Staging","hash":"_phase_1_staging","id":2},{"text":"Phase 2: Characterisation","hash":"_phase_2_characterisation","id":3},{"text":"Phase 3: Reuse","hash":"_phase_3_reuse","id":4},{"text":"Phase 4: Execute the Matching","hash":"_phase_4_execute_the_matching","id":5},{"text":"Phase 5: Validate Alignments","hash":"_phase_5_validate_alignments","id":6},{"text":"Phase 6: Application","hash":"_phase_6_application","id":7}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"Imagine different organisations speaking different dialects of the same language. One might say “Organisation,” another says “LegalEntity.” They’re both talking about similar things—but how do we get them to understand each other? Ontology alignment and mapping helps solve this problem by creating bridges between different models, allowing each organisation to keep their unique vocabulary while ensuring that the meaning is preserved. This tutorial demonstrates how to map the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) to Schema.org, addressing Use Case UC2.1. By following the map an existing model methodology, you’ll learn how to align these two vocabularies step-by-step—covering staging, characterisation, reuse, matching, alignment, and application—to ensure interoperability between the CBV and Schema.org. In this phase, the aim is to understand what needs to be mapped and why. For this tutorial, we aim to map the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) to Schema.org, enabling data interoperability. Determine the purpose of the mapping: What are the key areas of business data that need to be interoperable between CBV and Schema.org? This is carried out in collaboration with stakeholders. Define Scope: What parts of the Core Business Vocabulary need to be mapped to Schema.org? Are there specific concepts (e.g.,Contact Point, Organization, etc.) that must be represented? Which version of each ontology or vocabulary will be mapped? Set mapping Goals: Define the intended outcomes of the mapping, such as ensuring semantic alignment between CBV and Schema.org entities. For example, one key goal may be to clarify the relationship between legal:LegalEntity and schema:Organization (Issue #38) A short project specification listing target concepts and mapping objectives. The purpose, scope, and goals are determined by the stakeholders, including domain experts and knowledge engineers. First, the domain experts’ input is needed to demarcate the scope especially, indicating what the (sub-)topic of interest is, ideally augmented with key terms. For CBV and Schema.org, these may include terms such as: legal:LegalEntity vs. schema:Organization. It may also need to take into account ‘externalities’, such as regulatory compliance that may dictate the use of one version of a schema over another for some business reason. For the current exercise, there are no regulatory compliance requirements in place. Therefore, the latest official releases of both vocabularies will be used (Schema.org version 29.1 and CBV version 2.2.0). Next, clear mapping goals should be established. For this exercise, the primary goal is to identify direct relationships between the two vocabularies. These relationships will then be expressed in a machine-readable format, enabling seamless data transformation from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) to Schema.org. The aim of this phase is to analyse the structure, vocabulary, and semantics of the Core Business Vocabulary that we shall take as Source ontology and Schema.org that will be set as Target ontology. The key steps and outputs are as follows. Examine both ontologies for: Entity structures, definitions, and formats. Deprecation policies and inheritance mechanisms, natural language(s) used, label specification, label conventions, definition specification, definition conventions, version management and release cycles, etc. A comparison in the form of a table Optionally: a brief report containing a list of obstacles that need to be overcome before model matching can take place First, list the features on which to compare the source and the target, which concerns principally the ‘meta’ information, or: information about the artefacts, rather than its contents about the subject domain. This includes typical features such as the serialisation format(s) in which the artefacts are available, naming conventions of the terminology, and version management. The features can have adverse or facilitating consequences for the mapping task. Let’s consider three of them here and relate them to our case. First, are the files available in the same format? This is indeed the case for CBV and Schema.org, and even leaves the choice for using their RDF or JSON-LD format. The natural language of CVB and Schema.org, that is, the rendering of the entities’ names and labels, are both in one language, and so translating entities’ names is not needed. Regarding frequency of version updates, there is a notable difference. CBV is relatively stable with two main releases, whereas Schema.org has frequent releases and it is currently in its 29th main release cycle. . Second, we list the selected features in a table, and for each feature, find the answer for CBV and Schema.org. For the CBV and Schema.org metadata comparison, we had to consult the documentation, the developer release pages, and inspect the files to obtain the answers. The selected features and comparison with the values is shown in the table below. Feature Core Business Vocabulary Schema.org Specification HTML document HTML document Computer processable formats UML, RDF, JSON-LD, SHACL OWL, RDF (ttl, rdf/xml), CSV, JSON-LD, NQ, NT, SHACL, SHEXJ Inheritance Single inheritance Multiple inheritance Label rdfs:label, shacl:name (within SHACL shapes) rdfs:label Naming scheme CamelCase for classes (e.g., LegalEntity) and lowerCamelCase for properties CamelCase for classes (e.g., EducationalOrganization)and lowerCamelCase for properties Label formatting With spaces (e.g., Legal Entity) In CamelCase Language English English Deprecation No Yes Definitions rdfs:comment, shacl:description within SHACL shapes Written in rdfs:comment Latest version inspected Latest (v 2.0.0, 6-5-2024). 1 or 2 releases per year 29.0 (24-3-2025). 1 or 2 releases per year Developer location https://github.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary https://schema.org/docs/developers.html The aim of this phase is to avoid doing duplicate work by checking if any existing mappings between CBV and Schema.org are available for reuse or if there are any alignments that can be adapted for this project. Search for Existing Alignments: Looking for any pre-existing alignments that may have been created by others or as part of previous work by consulting the SEMIC GitHub repository for relevant mappings. Evaluate Reusability: Determine whether these existing alignments meet your project’s requirements. If they do, they can be reused directly. Adapt Existing Alignments: If the existing alignments are close but need modification, adapt them to suit the specific project goals. A document listing: which type of alignment was chosen for which existing alignments. The decisions: A new alignment needs to be created. There are three distinct pathways, being direct use, adaptive reuse, and creating a new alignment. Let’s look at each in turn. For the CBV and Schema.org, we first look for pre-existing alignments of related vocabularies. They may be in the files themselves, but we also can search a relevant repository with other files that may have relevant mappings, such the SEMIC GitHub repository in this case, and using alignment frameworks such as EDOAL or SSSOM. From searching through the SEMIC repository, we found several vocabularies that have alignments to Schema.org already, which may be reusable. They are listed in the following table, alongside with the location and at which date we checked the mapping, as it may change with different versions (recall the Source and Target Characterisation, above). Mapping From Mapping To Location Version CBV Schema.org https://github.com/SEMICeu/Semantic-Mappings/tree/main/Core%20Business CBV v2.2.0 – Schema.org v29.1 We then look at the intersection of CBV concepts and relationships with either of these. If so, we check if there is already a mapping from that element to Schema.org. This takes us to the Evaluate reusability step: and if it is an agreeable mapping between the two entities, we can reuse that mapping. Alternatively, it may be the case of adaptive reuse, which involves refinements to better suit the mapping objectives. Example: An existing alignment for LegalEntity to Organization was evaluated. However, it was missing relationships for organizational properties like schema:legalName and schema:taxID. So, the original alignment was extended to include new mappings for these properties. They may also be new alignments when existing resources are not suitable, which is the case for this tutorial. Example: Add alignment to answer the question: What is the relation between legal:LegalEntity and schema:Organization? At this step, we will perform the actual mapping, which we shall bootstrap by producing candidate mappings between classes and between properties, typically automatically,semi-automatically, or manually, and then assess the results. Select Matching Technique: Decide on a method for automatically or semi-automatically matching entities. Perform Matching: Prepare the inputs and use the chosen tool to generate potential matches between CBV and Schema.org entities. Candidate Evaluation: The knowledge engineer assesses the candidate correspondences for their consistency, accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the project’s requirements. List of alignments. In this tutorial, we use LIMES to automate link discovery in the mapping process between the CBV and Schema.org. While other tools could also be used, LIMES was selected for its simplicity and efficiency in performing lexical similarity-based alignments. Preparing the data sources depends on the files and the alignment tool chosen. To determine this, the table of features compiled in Phase 2 is useful: there it lists whether alignment should be run on the class name or the label, the file format, and any other algorithmic peculiarities that may be asked for, such as a similarity threshold. For our use case with CBV and Schema.org and LIMES, we begin by configuring the SPARQL endpoints, which allow us to extract the relevant classes and properties for comparison. We focus on aligning entities by their rdfs:label whose value is the name or description of the entity, which is the most straightforward way to identify potential mappings. LIMES uses a similarity metric to compare the rdfs:label values of entities from both files. This metric generates similarity scores based on the string matching of the labels and, optionally, their descriptions. Tools such as LIMES and Silk do not determine the semantic nature of the match (e.g., equivalence vs. subclass). They only suggest candidate pairs based on similarity metrics. It is up to the human expert to choose the appropriate relation, using knowledge of the domain and the ontology documentation. Once the matching process is complete, we inspect the results. In the case of the CBV and Schema.org alignment, no matches were found with LIMES. This means that the automated tool did not identify any significant similarities between entities based on the chosen similarity metric. Consequently, we need to either try with another alignment tool or manually review and align the entities. While we opt for the latter, let us first illustrate how the output would look if there had been potential matches. For instance, the Core Public Service Vocabulary (CPSV) as source against Schema.org does yield interesting results. LIMES output includes three key columns: Source entity: a URI from the source ontology (e.g., CPSV). Target entity: a URI from the target ontology (e.g., Schema.org). Similarity score: a numerical value (typically from 0 to 1) indicating the strength of the lexical similarity between the two entities. Even though the automated tool did not produce any alignments, we can use our domain knowledge to suggest potential mappings based on the descriptions and attributes of the entities. For example, CBV’s LegalEntity (that is an org:Organization) maps to Schema.org’s Organization based on their similar roles in representing business-related concepts, and likewise for CBV’s Address (imported from Core Location Vocabulary) with Schema.org PostalAddress. These kinds of alignments are made by examining the entity definitions and considering the context of their use in each ontology. After alignments (i.e., candidate mappings) have been generated—whether by automated tools or through manual assessment—each proposed mapping must be validated. This process aims at checking whether the candidate links represent semantically meaningful relationships between classes or properties from the two ontologies. Confirm candidate correspondences with domain experts. Review proposed alignments Decide on the appropriate semantic relation. Common types that we focus on here include: Equivalence: When two entities are conceptually and functionally the same → rendered as owl:equivalentClass or owl:equivalentProperty Subsumption: When one entity is more specific than the other (i.e., subclass or subproperty) → rendered as rdfs:subClassOf or rdfs:subPropertyOf Formalise the alignment into a mapping following conventions from the Alignment format or EDOAL. Render Mappings in a Machine-Readable Format. The mapping file can be rendered in RDF/XML, Turtle, or other formats like JSON-LD, depending on the tool or system in use. The choice of format should align with the needs of the stakeholders and the technical requirements of the project. While RDF/XML is a standard format for machine-readable ontology representations, it may not be ideal for human consumption due to its complexity. However, RDF/XML (or other syntaxes such as Turtle) is often used in formal contexts for consistency and integration with other semantic web tools. If ease of use for human review is desired, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or tools that visualize RDF data can provide a more intuitive way to view and edit mappings. Final alignment in RDF for integration Each candidate correspondence is checked for correctness and relevance. For CBV and Schema.org, we use a manual inspection by ontology engineers first , which includes cross-referencing documentation or definitions. CBV’s LegalEntity is “A self-employed person, company, or organization that has legal rights and obligations.” and Schema.org’s Organization is “An organization such as a school, NGO, corporation, club, etc.”. For Address, the descriptions are as follows: “A spatial object that in a human-readable way identifies a fixed location.” with a usage note indicating it to be understood as a postal address, and “The mailing address.”, respectively. For each validated candidate pair, determine the type of semantic relation. For our running example, CBV’s LegalEntity is almost the same as Schema.org’s Organization, but the latter does not have the “legal rights” constraint, and therefore, the appropriate semantic relation is that of subsumption. For the respective addresses, while CBV’s imported Address’ definition is broader than PostalAddress, and therefore suggesting a subsumption alignment as well, taking into account CBV’s usage note, it can be an equivalence alignment. Once the relation is chosen, each alignment is encoded as a machine-readable RDF triple, typically in RDF/XML or Turtle format, suitable for integration and reuse. The result is a validated alignment file, where each mapping is represented based on the Alignment Format or an extension thereof, such as EDOAL, as an align:Cell with: The aligned entities (align:entity1 and align:entity2) The chosen relation (align:relation), being either subsumption “<” or equivalence “=” An optional confidence measure Its corresponding meaning in the ontology (owl:annotatedProperty) Further information on a mapping justification, which reuses the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mapping SSSOM that, in turn, reuses the Semantic Mapping Vocabulary SEMAPV for the mapping justification values. Example output of adding an alignment between legal:LegalEntity and schema:Organization: http://mapping.semic.eu/business/sdo/cell/21 a align:Cell; align:entity1 http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity; align:entity2 https://schema.org/Organization; align:relation \"<\"; align:measure \"1\"^^xsd:float; owl:annotatedProperty rdfs:subClassOf; sssom:mapping_justification semapv:MappingReview . where it can be seen that the “<” relation corresponds to rdfs:subClassOf and the mapping justification is MappingReview, which is as approved as it can be in SEMAPV terminology. Other alignment examples and a complete file including prefixes can be viewed here. After alignments have been validated, the final step is to apply them in practice. This involves both technical integration and the establishment of a governance framework to ensure the mappings remain up to date and useful over time. Publish the Mappings: Share the mappings in a standard format via a repository. Integrate and Test: Apply the mappingsalignment in semantic web tools or data integration workflows. Establish Governance: Define a process for updating the mappings in response to changes in the source or target ontologies. Published mappings and insights for potential refinements. The mapping file (in RDF/Turtle format) resulting from our mapping exercise is published on the SEMIC GitHub repository. This allows for integration of the mapping output into validation tools used by Member States and other implementers to check CBV-compliant data against Schema.org requirements. For testing, one could attempt to load the files in an editor that can read in file of the chosen format, being Turtle for CBV, the Turtle version of Schema.org, and the alignment file, or run it trough a syntax validator to verify that all is in order for deployment. The governance structure for CBV and its mapping to Schema.org is on the side of CBV that reuses Schema.org. SEMIC is responsible for regularly checking if there are updates in either the CBV vocabulary or Schema.org (e.g., new classes, renamed terms, deprecated elements) and update where needed, see to it that logged issues are addressed, and verify that all links and namespaces still in working order. It may also consider updates to CBV due to changing requirements (e.g., to make CBV multilingual) and plan any consequent updates to CBV and any potential effects it may have on the mappings with Schema.org. To demonstrate the practical value of the mapping between CBV and Schema.org, we use SPARQL Anything to query instance data alongside the alignment file. We assume: A data file (core-business-ap.ttl) contains an instance of legal:LegalEntity An alignment file (Alignment-CoreBusiness-2.2.0-schemaorg.ttl) defines a mapping from legal:LegalEntity to schema:Organization. PREFIX xyz: http://sparql.xyz/facade-x/data/ PREFIX legal: http://www.w3.org/ns/legal# PREFIX align: http://knowledgeweb.semanticweb.org/heterogeneity/alignment# PREFIX rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# CONSTRUCT { ?s a ?entity2 . } WHERE { SERVICE x-sparql-anyhintg:app/core-business-ap.ttl { ?s a ?entity1 . } SERVICE x-sparql-anything:app/Alignment-CoreBusiness-2.2.0-schemaorg.ttl { ?align a align:Cell ; align:entity1 ?entity1 ; align:entity2 ?entity2 . FILTER (?entity1 = legal:LegalEntity) } } It checks for instances of legal:LegalEntity in the data file, and if the alignment file contains a mapping for it, it infers the equivalent or related Schema.org class (schema:Organization). http://example.org/entities/Company123 a https://schema.org/Organization .","title":"UC 2.1 Tutorial on Mapping an existing Model to a Core Vocabulary","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"map-existing-ontology-to-vocabulary","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/map-existing-ontology-to-vocabulary.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1: Staging (Defining the Requirements)","hash":"_phase_1_staging_defining_the_requirements","id":2},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps","id":3},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output","id":4},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org","id":5},{"text":"Phase 2: Characterisation (Defining Source and Target Data)","hash":"_phase_2_characterisation_defining_source_and_target_data","id":6},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_2","id":7},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_2","id":8},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_2","id":9},{"text":"Phase 3: Reuse of Existing Mappings","hash":"_phase_3_reuse_of_existing_mappings","id":10},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_3","id":11},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_3","id":12},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_3","id":13},{"text":"Phase 4: Matching (Execute and Filter Matching Candidates)","hash":"_phase_4_matching_execute_and_filter_matching_candidates","id":14},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_4","id":15},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_4","id":16},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_4","id":17},{"text":"Set Up Data Sources","hash":"_set_up_data_sources","id":18},{"text":"Apply Matching Algorithm","hash":"_apply_matching_algorithm","id":19},{"text":"Analyse Results","hash":"_analyse_results","id":20},{"text":"Manual Alignment Process","hash":"_manual_alignment_process","id":21},{"text":"Phase 5: Validate Alignments","hash":"_phase_5_validate_alignments","id":22},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps_5","id":23},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_5","id":24},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_5","id":25},{"text":"Review Proposed Alignments","hash":"_review_proposed_alignments","id":26},{"text":"Decide the Appropriate Semantic Relation","hash":"_decide_the_appropriate_semantic_relation","id":27},{"text":"Formalise the Alignment","hash":"_formalise_the_alignment","id":28},{"text":"Phase 6: Application (Operationalise the Mappings)","hash":"_phase_6_application_operationalise_the_mappings","id":29},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_6","id":30},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_6","id":31},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_6","id":32},{"text":"Real Example Using SPARQL Anything","hash":"_real_example_using_sparql_anything","id":33},{"text":"Scenario","hash":"_scenario","id":34},{"text":"SPARQL Query","hash":"_sparql_query","id":35},{"text":"What This Query Does","hash":"_what_this_query_does","id":36},{"text":"Output","hash":"_output_7","id":37}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"Use Case UC2.2 focuses on enabling data interoperability by converting XML data into RDF format, ensuring that it adheres to the semantic standards defined by the chosen Core Vocabulary. Specifically, it zooms in on the process of mapping an existing XML Schema Definition (XSD) to a Core Vocabulary. For this tutorial, we will use the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). The procedure involves defining the transformation rules that align data from the existing XSD to the concepts and terms of the Core Vocabulary. . This tutorial guides you through the key steps in creating the mappings to Core Vocabularies (CV) involving: Understanding the XSD Schema and the mapping process; Creating a conceptual mapping between the XSD schema and vocabulary in RDF; Creating the technical mapping; Validating the RDF output; Disseminating the outcome. The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) XSD file defines several key entities for the domain, including: AccountingDocument: Financial and non-financial information resulting from an activity of an organization. BusinessAgent: An entity capable of performing actions, potentially associated with a person or an organization. FormalOrganization and LegalEntity: Legal and formal entities with rights and obligations. ContactPoint: Contact details for an entity, such as email, phone, etc. RegisteredAddress: The address at which the Legal Entity is legally registered. Before initiating the mapping development process,it’s essential to prepare representative test data. This data should align with the structure defined in the XSD schema and cover various use cases and scenarios that might occur in production data. For this tutorial, we will use the SampleData_Business.xml file available on the SEMIC GitHub repository. Ensure that the XML data contains relevant elements, such as , , , and , which you will later map to the Core Business Vocabulary terms. We will create a conceptual mapping between the XSD elements and RDF terms from the Core Business Vocabulary. This will guide the transformation of the XML data to RDF. There are two levels of conceptual mapping: Vocabulary Level Mapping: This is a basic alignment, where each XML element is directly mapped to an ontology class or property. Example: is mapped to cv:RegisteredAddress and is mapped to legal:LegalEntity. Application Profile Level Mapping: At this level, you use XPath expressions to extract specific data from the XML structure, ensuring a more precise mapping to the Core Vocabulary. Example: Mapping the address fields from the XML to a specific property, such as locn:postCode or locn:postName. In both cases, the target is declared in two components: the target property path and the target class path, to ensure it is mapped in the right context. For instance, a locn:postName of a legal entity may well have different components compared to a locn:postName of the address of a physical building. Example of the Conceptual Mapping for the five selected elements of the XSD schema : Source XPath Target Property Path Target Class Path */AccountingDocument ?this a cv:AccountingDocument . cv:AccountingDocument */LegalEntity ?this a legal:LegalEntity . legal:LegalEntity */LegalEntity/LegalName ?this legal:legalName ?value legal:LegalEntity */ContactPoint ?this a cv:ContactPoint . cv:ContactPoint The RDF Mapping Language (RML) is ideal for the task of implementing the conceptual mappings as technical mappings, because it allows for seamless mapping from XML to RDF. We will use RML to create machine-executable mapping rules as follows. First, the rml:logicalSource is declared, with the root of the tree in the XML file, which is */LegalEntity in our use case that assumes there to be an rml:source called SampleData_Business.xml with instance data. Next, a rr:subjectMap is added to say how each node becomes the RDF subject—here we build an IRI from generate-id(.) and type it as legal:LegalEntity. Finally, one or more rr:predicateObjectMap blocks capture the properties we need; in the simplest case we map the child element to the vocabulary property legal:legalName. The complete example RML mapping code looks as follows, in Turtle syntax: @prefix rr: . @prefix rml: . @prefix ql: . @prefix ex: . @prefix : . @prefix xsd: . @prefix legal: @prefix rdfs: . ex:Organization a rr:TriplesMap ; rdfs:label \"Organisation\" ; rml:logicalSource [ rml:source “SampleData_Business.xml” ; rml:iterator \"*/LegalEntity\" ; rml:referenceFormulation ql:XPath ] ; rr:subjectMap [ rdfs:label \"LegalEntity\" ; rr:template \"http://example.cv/resource#Organisation_{generate-id(.)}\" ; rr:class legal:LegalEntity ; ] ; rr:predicateObjectMap [ rdfs:label \"LegalName\" ; rr:predicate legal:legalName ; rr:objectMap [ rml:reference \"LegalEntity/LegalName\" ; ] ] ; . This needs to be carried out for all elements from the XSD that were selected for mapping in Phase 1. Now that we have created the mappings, we can apply them to sample data using RMLMapper or a similar tool selected from the SEMIC Tooling Assistant. For this tutorial, we will use RMLMapper, which will read the RML mapping file and the input XML data, and then generate the corresponding RDF output. The snippet below is a single triple set produced when the mapping is run over the sample file SampleData_Business.xml (see Phase 1). It shows that one of the XML records—the Belgian committee for UNICEF—has been turned into an RDF resource of type legal:LegalEntity with its legal:legalName correctly populated. @prefix legal: . @prefix cv: . @prefix ex: . ex:Organization_1 a legal:LegalEntity ; legal:legalName \"Comité belge pour l'UNICEF\" . We will validate the output in two ways: to check that it exists and the graph and to check that it exists as intended also regarding any constraints on the shape of the graph. You can validate the generated RDF using SPARQL queries to ensure that the transformation adheres to the defined conceptual mapping. Since we want to validate rather than retrieve information, we use SPARQL ASK queries, which will return either a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. For our running example, the SPARQL query for validating the LegalEntity is: ASK { ?e a ; ?name . } SHACL validation can be applied to ensure that the RDF data conforms to the required shapes and structures regarding any constraints that must hold. An example SHACL shape for validating LegalEntity is: To create a SHACL shape for the given RDF output, where the LegalEntity (legal:LegalEntity) has a legalName property, we need to define a SHACL shape that validates the type of the LegalEntity, the presence of the legalName property, and its datatype. @prefix sh: . @prefix cv: . @prefix ex: . @prefix xsd: . @prefix legal: . # Define a shape for LegalEntity ex:LegalEntityShape a sh:NodeShape ; sh:targetClass legal:LegalEntity ; # This shape applies to all instances of LegalEntity sh:property [ sh:path legal:legalName ; # Ensure the presence of the legalName property sh:datatype xsd:string ; # legalName must be a string sh:minCount 1 ; # At least one legalName must be provided ] . Target Class: The shape is applied to all resources of type legal:LegalEntity. This means it validates any LegalEntity instance in your RDF data. Property Constraints: legal:legalName: The property legalName is required to be of type xsd:string, and the minimum count is set to 1 (sh:minCount 1), meaning that the legalName property must appear at least once. Note: The SHACL shapes of the CBV can be found here. Once the mappings are validated, the next step is to disseminate the mapping as a package of documentation together with the artefacts. The package includes: Conceptual Mapping Files: This documents the mapping rules between XSD elements and RDF terms, being the table included above in Phase 2. Technical Mapping Files: These include the RML or code for data transformation, which were developed in Phase 3. Test Data: The representative set of XML files for testing the mappings that were created in Phase 1. Validation Reports: The SPARQL and SHACL validation results obtained from Phase 4.","title":"Tutorial: Mapping the Core Business Vocabulary from XSD to RDF","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"map-xsd-to-cv","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/map-xsd-to-cv.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Phase1: Understand the XSD schema and Preparing the test data","hash":"_phase1_understand_the_xsd_schema_and_preparing_the_test_data","id":2},{"text":"Understanding the XML schema","hash":"_understanding_the_xml_schema","id":3},{"text":"Preparing the Test Data","hash":"_preparing_the_test_data","id":4},{"text":"Phase 2: Create a Conceptual Mapping","hash":"_phase_2_create_a_conceptual_mapping","id":5},{"text":"Phase 3: Create the Technical Mapping","hash":"_phase_3_create_the_technical_mapping","id":6},{"text":"Phase 4: Validate the RDF Output","hash":"_phase_4_validate_the_rdf_output","id":7},{"text":"Explanation:","hash":"_explanation","id":8},{"text":"Phase 5: Dissemination","hash":"_phase_5_dissemination","id":9}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"[eif] New European Interoperability Framework.

Since 2011, the European Commission facilitates international working groups to forge consensus and maintain the SEMIC Core Vocabularies. A short description of these vocabularies is included in the Table below. The latest release of the Core Vocabularies can be retrieved via the SEMIC Support Center [semic] or directly from the GitHub repository [semic-gh]. Vocabulary Description The Core Person Vocabulary (CPV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a person; e.g., the name, gender, date of birth, and location. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing person-related information. The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity; e.g., the legal name, activity, and address. The Core Business Vocabulary includes a minimal number of classes and properties modelled to capture the typical details recorded by business registers. It facilitates information exchange between business registers despite differences in what they record and publish. The Core Location Vocabulary (CLV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. The Location Core Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a location represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. This specification enables interoperability among land registers and any other ICT based solution exchanging and processing location information. The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) supports the exchange of information between organisations that define criteria and organisations that respond to these criteria by means of evidence. The Core Evidence and Core Criterion Vocabulary (CCCEV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate development of interoperable information systems: the use of common vocabularies to describe criteria and evidence facilitates the development of information systems and improves their interoperability. Create a repository of reusable criteria in machine-readable formats: the use of common vocabularies promotes the creation of a repository of criteria and evidence information. Automate the assessment of criteria: the Core Vocabulary describing the criterion responses allows systems to easily compare the information collected from different parties and enables automatic assessment of the responses for a specific criterion. Automate scoring of responses: weighting criteria, the assessment can be followed by an automated scoring of the responses provided by different parties. Promote cross-border participation in public procurement: the use of the Core Vocabulary for electronic criterion and evidence allows for removing language barriers thereby improving the cross border exchange of information, and the cross-border participation in pan-European selection processes. Calculating statistics: standardising data for criterion, criterion responses and evidence allows calculating statistical information on the most commonly used criteria for a given process, the most relevant evidence, etc. Create a registry of mappings of criteria: using the Core Vocabulary, it is possible to create a registry of mappings to allow cross-checking of the criteria with the evidence of each particular Member State. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary provides a common data model for describing public organisations in the European Union. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary (CPOV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate information sharing: the CPOV enables G2G (Government-to-Government), G2B (Government-to-Business) and G2C (Government-to-Citizen) information sharing. Facilitate the development of common information systems: the use of existing data models for the development of common information systems facilitates the development of those systems and improves their interoperability. Linked Open Organograms: the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary has the potential to link organograms to each other and to high-value data sets. Cross border information exchange: the CPOV allows the management of a cross-border repository of public services and organisations. Find a PO by its function: the public organisation portfolio facilitates discovery of which public authorities and departments are responsible for given areas of the public task. Increase efficiency: the CPOV helps to identify where responsibilities and functions are duplicated or overlap. The Core Public Event Vocabulary (CPEV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a public event, e.g. the title, the date, the location, the organiser etc. The Core Public Event Vocabulary aspires to become a common data model for describing public events (conferences, summits, etc.) in the European Union. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing information related to public events. The Core Vocabularies are semantic data specifications that are disseminated as the following artefacts: lightweight ontology [sem-sg-wio] for vocabulary definition expressed in OWL [owl2]; loose data shape specification [sem-sg-wds] expressed in SHACL [shacl]; human-readable reference documentation [sem-sg-wdsd] in HTML (based on ReSpec [respec]); JSON-LD [w3c] context definitions [json-ld]; conceptual model specification [sem-sg-wcm] expressed in UML [uml]. The Core Vocabularies are published under the CC-BY 4.0 licence [cc-by]. The Core Vocabularies have been developed following the ‘Process and methodology for developing Core Vocabularies’ [cv-met], which has an open change and release management process , supported by SEMIC, that ensures continuous improvement and relevance to evolving user needs. This process begins with the identification of needs from stakeholders or issues raised in existing implementations. The Working Group members, SEMIC team or community of users propose changes that are thoroughly assessed for their impact and feasibility. Once a change is deemed necessary, it undergoes a drafting phase where the technical details are fleshed out, followed by public consultations to gather wider input and ensure transparency. Following consultations, the changes are refined and prepared for implementation. This stage may involve further iteration based on feedback or additional insights from ongoing discussions. The finalised changes are then formally approved and documented, ensuring they are well-understood and agreed upon by all relevant parties. The release management of Core Vocabularies follows a structured timeline that includes pre-announced releases and public consultation periods to allow users to prepare for changes. Each release includes detailed documentation to support implementation, ensuring users can integrate new versions with minimal disruption. This process not only maintains the quality and relevance of the Core Vocabularies, but also supports a dynamic and responsive framework for semantic interoperability within digital public services. Claiming conformance to Core Vocabularies is an integral part of validating (a) how well a new or a mapped data model or semantic data specification aligns with the principles and practices established in the SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] and (b) to what degree the Core Vocabularies are reused (fully or partially) [sem-sg-reuse]. The conformance assessment is voluntary, and shall be published as a self-conformance statement. This statement must assert which requirements are met by the data model or semantic specification. The conformance statement highlights various levels of adherence, ranging from basic implementation to more complex semantic representations. At the basic level, conformance might simply involve ensuring that data usage is consistent with the terms (and structure, but no formal semantics) defined by the Core Vocabularies. Moving to a more advanced level of conformance, data may be easily transformed into formats like RDF or JSON-LD, which are conducive to richer semantic processing and integration. This level of conformance signifies a deeper integration of the Core Vocabularies, facilitating a more robust semantic interoperability across systems. Ultimately, the highest level of conformance is achieved when the data is represented in RDF and fully leverages the semantic capabilities of the Core Vocabularies. This includes using a range of semantic technologies, adhering to the SEMIC Style Guide, fully reusing the Core Vocabularies, and respecting the associated data shapes.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"semic-core-vocabularies","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/semic-core-vocabularies.html","titles":[{"text":"SEMIC Core Vocabularies","hash":"corevocabs","id":1},{"text":"Representation formats","hash":"sec:representation-formats","id":2},{"text":"Licensing conditions","hash":"sec:licensing-conditions","id":3},{"text":"Core Vocabularies lifecycle","hash":"sec:core-vocabularies-lifecycle","id":4},{"text":"Claiming conformance","hash":"sec:claiming-conformance","id":5}]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"This handbook serves as a practical guide for using Core Vocabularies in various common situations. To provide clear and actionable insights, we have categorized potential use cases into two groups: Primary Use Cases: These are the most common, interesting, and/or challenging scenarios, all thoroughly covered within this handbook. Additional Use Cases: These briefly introduce other relevant scenarios but are not elaborated on in detail in this handbook. Within both groups, we differentiate between use cases focused on the creation of NEW artefacts and those involving the mapping of EXISTING artefacts to Core Vocabularies. For a better overview, we numbered the use cases and organised them into two diagrams, followed by the description of these use cases in two separate subsections, one dedicated to the addressed use cases and one to the use cases that are not addressed in this handbook. The use cases provided in this handbook are written in white-box point of style oriented towards user goals following the classification of [Cockburn99]. We will use the following template to describe the relevant use cases: Use Case : Title of the use case Goal: A succinct sentence describing the goal of the use case Primary Actor: The primary actor or actors of this use case Actors: (Optional) Other actors involved in the use case Description: Short description of the use case providing relevant information for its understanding Example: An example to illustrate the application of this use case Note: (Optional) notes about this use case, especially related to its coverage in this handbook Use Case UC1: Create a new information exchange data model Goal: Create a new standalone data schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. Note: As this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data formats. Use Case UC1.1: Create a new XSD schema Goal: Create a new standalone XSD schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new XSD schema that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, an XSD Schema can be used to create and validate XML data to be exchanged between information systems. Example: OOTS XML schema mappings [oots] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Create a new XSD schema Use Case UC1.2: Create a new JSON-LD context definition Goal: Create a new standalone JSON-LD context definition that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new JSON-LD context definition that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, a JSON-LD context definition can be integrated in describing data, building APIs, and other operations involved in information exchange. Example: Core Person Vocabulary [cpv-json-ld], Core Business Vocabulary [cbv-json-ld] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for use cases will be provided in the Create a new JSON-LD context definition section. Use Case UC2: Map an existing data model to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping of an existing (information exchange) data model, to terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a mapping of an ontology, vocabulary, or some kind of data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, to terms from CVs. Such a mapping can be done at a conceptual level, or formally, e.g. in the form of transformation rules, and most often will include both. Note: Since this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data models and/or data formats. Some of those use cases will be described in detail below, while others will be included in the Appendix, which is dedicated to the additional use cases. Use Case UC2.1: Map an existing Ontology to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping between the terms of an existing ontology and the terms of Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping expressed in Semantic Web terminology (for example using rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, owl:sameAs properties), associating the terms in an existing ontology that defines relevant concepts in a given domain, to terms defined in one or more CVs. This activity is usually performed by a semantic engineer based on input received from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping associates the terms in an existing ontology, which defines relevant concepts within a specific domain, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. The result of the formal mapping can be used later by software engineers to build information exchange systems. Example: Mapping Core Person to Schema.org [map-cp2org], Core Business to Schema.org [map-cb2org], etc. Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing Model section. Use Case UC2.2: Map an existing XSD Schema to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Define the data transformation rules for the mapping of an XSD schema to terms from Core Vocabularies. Create a mapping of XML data that conforms to an existing XSD schema to an RDF representation that conforms to a Core Vocabulary for formal data transformation. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. RML or other languages), to allow automated translation of XML data conforming to a certain XSD schema, to RDF data expressed in terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. This use case required definitions of an Application Profile for a Core Vocabulary because the CV alone does not specify sufficient instantiation constraints to be precisely mappable. Such activity can be done by semantic engineers based on input from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping is usually used as the basis for the formal mapping. The conceptual mapping can be a simple correspondence table associating the XML Elements defined in an XSD schema, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. In some cases the creation of the conceptual mapping can be done by the semantic engineers themselves, or even by the software engineers building information exchange systems. Example: ISA2core SAWSDL mapping [isa2-map] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing XSD schema section. The additional use cases are described in the Appendix.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"develop","name":"use-cases","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/develop/use-cases.html","titles":[{"text":"Use cases","hash":"_use_cases","id":1},{"text":"Primary use cases","hash":"sec:uc1","id":2}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"Sharing data easily is indispensable for effective and efficient public services. Sharing may be through offering one point of access, and often involves reusing the data in multiple applications across multiple departments and organisations. To make this work, the systems need to be interoperable. Following the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), interoperability is defined as “the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems”, where, for the purpose of EIF ‘organisations’ refers to “public administration units or any entity acting on their behalf, or EU institutions or bodies”. It is what “enables administrations to cooperate and make public services function across borders, across sectors and across organisational boundaries.”, including enabling “public sector actors to connect, cooperate and exchange data while safeguarding sovereignty and subsidiarity”, as described in EUR-Lex-52022DC0710. The requirement for interoperability has been identified at the European Commission (EC) level and consequently different actions and regulations are established to facilitate and support interoperability (summarised below). They stress that data must be shared with a shared understanding EIF such that the meaning of the data is preserved over time, when it is shared between co-legislators and across agencies in whole or in part, when it is transferred between systems of different agencies, and when it is used in the various information systems implemented with distinct technologies. In the context of public sector interoperability specifically, it functions as an enabler of a number of benefits. Among others, the EC has identified in EUR-Lex-52022DC0710 that it will contribute to GDP growth and will be a cost-saver: an \"estimated increase of 0.4% in EU GDP\" and saving individuals \"up to 24 million hours a year, or EUR 543 million\", whereas \"[b]usinesses could save 30 billion hours or EUR 568 billion a year.\" (cited source) will contribute positively to public values, as it already has done for multilingualism and inclusive public services. and it is \"to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market\" both within and between sectors (Data governance act). Mechanisms that foster interoperability contribute to improving individuals’ and businesses’ access to data to encourage data-driven innovation and a more integrated and efficient data economy. A prerequisite for this is that the data must have a clearly specified meaning so that it will be used correctly by all users sharing the same understanding about that data. This, in turn, also contributes to clear data provenance and correctness for the data stored and used, which is important for increasing trust and data availability. These capabilities could further contribute to consistent interpretation and foster reliable data sharing and access across multiple sectors and administrative levels, which may also contribute to policymaking and implementation. The European Union has formulated Acts, regulations, and frameworks that intend to foster achieving that, including the Data Act, the Data Governance Act, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), and the Interoperable Europe Act, which underscore the importance of harmonised data practices across member states. These Acts and frameworks emphasise that true interoperability goes far beyond just connecting systems at a technical level. The EU Data Act is a legislative framework aimed at enhancing the EU’s data economy by improving access to data for individuals and businesses. It entered into force on January 11, 2024, and is designed to ensure fairness in data allocation and encourage data-driven innovation. The Data Governance Act (DGA) is a regulation by the European Union aimed at facilitating data sharing and increasing trust in data usage. It establishes a framework for the reuse of publicly held data and encourages the sharing of data for altruistic purposes, while also regulating data intermediaries to enhance data availability and overcome technical barriers. The act is part of the broader European strategy for data, which seeks to create a more integrated and efficient data economy. The EIF provides specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services. It gives guidance, through a set of recommendations, to public administrations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. The Interoperable Europe Act, which entered into force on 11 April 2024, aims to enhance cross-border interoperability and cooperation in the public sector across the EU. It is designed to support the objectives of the Digital Decade, ensuring that 100% of key public services are available online by 2030, including those requiring cross-border data exchange. The Act addresses challenges by creating tools for interoperability within public administrations and removing legal, organizational, and technical obstacles. It envisions an emerging ‘network of networks’ of largely sovereign actors at all levels of government, each with their own legal framework and mandates, yet all interconnected”, i.e., for seamless cross-border cooperation, which is to be supported by mandatory assessments. To achieve interoperability, one has to elucidate its multiple interacting sub-components. This could be along the line of the high-level conceptual model of the EIF, which intersects with national interoperability frameworks and domain-specific interoperability frameworks such as the INSPIRE Directive. In the EIF toolbox, each higher layer rests upon an interoperable lower layer of infrastructure; e.g., organisational interoperability requires semantic operability such that information can be exchanged seamlessly, which, in turn, requires IT infrastructure interoperability. They also can be viewed as layers of local, provincial, national, and EU-wide levels of interoperability to accommodate a plethora of e-Government information exchange scenarios or smart cities and communities specifically (EIF4SCC). Alternatively, an interoperability framework can be envisioned as foundations upon which government services are built (MIOS), or as one of the constituent pillars that enable goals such as citizen convenience, increased productivity, and lower costs of government operations. In sum, there are two key reasons to seek interoperability in public administrations: Instrumental Value – Standardised data and information exchange simplifies cross-border operations, enabling organisations to: comply with regulations more easily; contribute to reducing overhead costs by automating processes and paperwork across ministries that would have to be carried out only once; streamline administrative tasks and data accuracy, preventing misinterpretation of data through standardised data exchange; improve service delivery. Legal Requirements – EU regulations and policy frameworks such as the Data Act, Data Governance Act, and the Interoperable Europe Act for structured and secure data exchange. Compliance ensures smoother interactions with public authorities. While data exchange is an evident requirement for interoperability, there are fine but crucial distinctions between data format, syntactic, and semantic interoperability. A standardised syntax and data format to store data lets one exchange data, such as creating an SQL database dump in one tool and seamlessly reopening it in another, or lets one send and receive emails that arrive properly in each other’s inbox. Interoperability at the semantic level concerns the meaning of that data. One may have a format and language to represent data, such as XML, but with a tag … , neither the software nor the humans can determine from just that what sort of bank is enclosed within the tags. Such meaning is defined in artefacts including vocabularies, thesauri, and ontologies. A “” tag in a document is then an implemented version of its definition at the semantic layer, where it has a definition and a number of properties specified, like that the fin:bank is a type of organisation with a board of directors and a location for its headquarters. This enables not only correct sending and receiving of data, but also exchanging data reliably, accessing the right data when querying for information and obtaining relevant data in the query answer, and merging data. According to the Revised EIF, section 3.5, semantic interoperability \"ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties, in other words ‘what is sent is what is understood’.\" Besides aforementioned syntactic interoperability, it has the semantic component as well, which \"refers to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them.\" and \"includes developing vocabularies and schemata to describe data exchanges\". One recommended way to achieve semantic interoperability between public administrations is to use Core Vocabularies, which is where the terms are specified and disambiguated. A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable, and extensible specification that captures the relevant characteristics of entities, which can be used to add semantics to data and information that captures the essential characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral manner. Its primary purpose is to provide standardised terms that can be reused across various application domains, typically realised as a lightweight ontology (optionally accompanied by a permissive data shape) and documented in a concise specification. Core vocabularies for SEMIC were created as part of the ISA2 program and are described further below in the Core Vocabularies section. Imagine you are starting a business in another EU country. To complete the registration, you need to submit a criminal record certificate and a diploma certificate to multiple public organisations. In many countries, this process is still manual—people must physically visit different ministries, request documents, and submit them in person or via email. Each organisation may use different formats and terminology, making it difficult for institutions to interpret and process the information correctly, possibly making mistakes during data entry due to terminological confusion that subsequently have to be corrected. Without a common reference vocabulary, these organizations interpret the data differently, making seamless exchange impossible. Now, imagine an alternative scenario, such as indicated by the Once-Only Technical System (OOTS) for the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, where this entire process is fully automated. Instead of individuals having to visit multiple offices, the ministries and public administrations would communicate directly with each other, exchanging the necessary information in a structured and consistent manner. The citizen could simply grant approval to the administration office to fetch the data from their home country that already had recorded the relevant data. This would eliminate the need for duplicate document submissions and avoid possible data entry issues, thereby reducing the hassle and costs of mobility. This is also the aim of the . Defining the what is one step; the how to achieve it is another. How can different systems and institutions \"talk\" to each other effectively at the level of software applications and databases? The challenge is not only technical but also semantic. It is not enough for systems to simply exchange data—they must also be able to interpret the meaning behind the data in a consistent way such that it will not result in errors or so-called 'dirty' (incorrect or incomplete) data. This requires a common language and a (multilingual) structured vocabulary at both the business process level and the IT systems level. This is where standards to declare the semantics play a crucial role. By using core vocabularies, public administrations can ensure that data and information are structured in a way understood by both humans and machines. Standardised models allow different organisations to recognise and process information without discrepancies, therewith reducing errors and the need for manual intervention. As a result, governments can facilitate seamless data exchange, ensuring that information is accurately shared, interpreted, and processed across systems, leading to more efficient approvals and interactions for businesses, governmental organisations, and citizens. This handbook is intended for two main audiences: 1) administrative professionals and legal experts, and 2) technical experts and IT professionals. Public administrations involve both legal/administrative experts and technical professionals. While they may not always “speak the same language”, they must work together to ensure smooth digital transformation. Semantic interoperability provides the common foundation that allows them to bridge their disciplinary differences and find common ground, enabling effective collaboration and thereby contributing to improved public services. Each intended audience will gain new insights relevant for their respective roles By reading this handbook, domain experts will Understand the role of semantic interoperability at the EU level, which might also be of use at the national, regional, and local level. Gain insight about how structured data and shared vocabularies enhance legal clarity, data exchange, and cross-border cooperation. Gain insights into how interoperability supports public services and reduces administrative burdens. It is expected that this will facilitate coordination with technical teams to ensure that interoperability initiatives meet both legal and operational requirements and assist the administrative professionals and legal experts in making informed decisions about financing and prioritising IT projects that align with interoperability goals. By engaging with this handbook as both a reference manual and a practical guide, the technical experts and IT professionals who design, implement, and maintain the software ecosystem will: Learn how to design and implement interoperable systems using Core Vocabularies and semantic data models. Understand methodologies for creating, mapping, and integrating semantic data models in public administration systems. Be able to apply best practices for data exchange, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different systems. Use standardised approaches to enhance data accessibility, transparency, and reuse in line with FAIR principles. Ensure compliance with Semic style-guide principles. It is expected that this will not only facilitate communication with the domain experts, but also further streamline software development conformant to the user specification and, ultimately, the citizens who benefit from more smoothly functioning digital services. The SEMIC Core Vocabularies Handbook is designed to practically guide public administrations in achieving semantic interoperability. It provides clear guidance on how to use core vocabularies to create semantic data specifications that align with EU initiatives, how to reuse them, and how to implement them. Additionally, it outlines key use cases demonstrating practical applications of these vocabularies. The Handbook has two types of content: Explanatory Sections: Intended for administrative professionals and legal experts. They explain the role of Core Vocabularies, along with relevant use cases and a conceptual framework. It helps non-technical stakeholders understand why semantic interoperability matters and how it supports policy implementation. Practical Guidance Sections: Designed for technical experts, data architects, and IT professionals, which provide methodologies and step-by-step tutorials for adopting and implementing Core Vocabularies. It includes instructions on creating new semantic data specifications by extending Core Vocabularies, mapping existing data models to them, and ensuring interoperability through standardised practices. The structure of the main part of the handbook is as follows. First, several principal use cases will be introduced, which feature the most common, challenging, and interesting scenarios. It is augmented with other scenarios to indicate further possible usage. This is followed by guidelines for implementation, which includes procedures for how to create new models and how to map existing ones. These guidelines are demonstrated in the tutorials and examples for the use cases. Finally, the appendix contains a glossary of terms for easy reference and usecases not covered in this handbook.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"Introduction to interoperability","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/Introduction%20to%20interoperability.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction to interoperability","hash":"_introduction_to_interoperability","id":1},{"text":"What is interoperability","hash":"_what_is_interoperability","id":2},{"text":"Why is interoperability needed?","hash":"_why_is_interoperability_needed","id":3},{"text":"Existing acts and frameworks","hash":"existing-acts","id":4},{"text":"What is semantic interoperability and how to achieve it","hash":"_what_is_semantic_interoperability_and_how_to_achieve_it","id":5},{"text":"What is a Core Vocabulary?","hash":"_what_is_a_core_vocabulary","id":6},{"text":"A Practical Example","hash":"_a_practical_example","id":7},{"text":"Who shall read this Handbook","hash":"_who_shall_read_this_handbook","id":8},{"text":"Administrative Professionals & Legal Experts","hash":"_administrative_professionals_legal_experts","id":9},{"text":"Technical Experts & IT Professionals","hash":"_technical_experts_it_professionals","id":10},{"text":"How this Handbook is structured","hash":"_how_this_handbook_is_structured","id":11}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"Use case 1.2 to create a new JSON-LD context definition is specified as follows. Use Case UC1.2: Create a new JSON-LD context definition Goal: Create a new standalone JSON-LD context definition that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new JSON-LD context definition that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, a JSON-LD context definition can be integrated in describing data, building APIs, and other operations involved in information exchange. Example: Core Person Vocabulary [cpv-json-ld], Core Business Vocabulary [cbv-json-ld] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for use cases will be provided in the Create a new JSON-LD context definition section. This section provides guidelines for addressing use case UC1.2. JSON-LD is a W3C Recommendation for serialising Linked Data, combining the simplicity, power, and Web ubiquity of JSON with the concepts of Linked Data. Creating JSON-LD context definitions facilitates this synergy. This ensures that when data is shared or integrated across systems, it maintains its meaning and can be understood in the same way across different contexts. This guide describes how to create new JSON-LD contexts for existing Core Vocabularies. The three key phases are: Import or define elements Shape structure Review and validate When a Core Vocabulary has defined an associated JSON-LD context already, it is not only easy, but also advisable to directly import this context using the @import keyword. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. In cases where the Core Vocabulary does not provide an JSON-LD context, it is necessary to create the corresponding field element definitions for the reused URIs. To start, gather all the terms from the selected Core Vocabulary that need to be included in the JSON-LD context. Then, decide the desired structure of the JSON-LD file, by defining the corresponding keys, such as Person.givenName. These new fields must adhere to the naming defined by the selected Core Vocabulary to maintain consistency. Finally, assign URIs to keys. Each term in the JSON-LD context must be associated with a URI from an ontology that defines its meaning in a globally unambiguous way. Associate the URIs established in Core Vocabularies to JSON keys using the same CV terms. The ones that are imported by the Core Vocabularies, shall be used as originally defined. Start with defining the structure of the context by relating class terms with property terms and then, if necessary, property terms with other classes. Commence by creating a JSON structure that starts with a @context field. This field will contain mappings from one’s own vocabulary terms to other’s respective URIs. Continue by defining fields for Classes and subfields for their properties. If the JSON-LD context is developed with the aim of being used directly in exchange specific to an application scenario, then aim to establish a complete tree structure that starts with a single root class. To do so, specify precise @type references linking to the specific Class. If the aim of the developed JSON-LD context is rather ensuring semantic correspondences, without any structural constraints, which is the case for core or domain semantic data specification, then definitions of structures specific to each entity type and its properties suffice, using only loose references to other objects. To meet wishes from API consumers, one may use aliasing of keywords, where a JSON-LD context element is given a more easily recognisable string. One can also extend the context by reusing terms from Core Vocabularies, which also uses the @import keyword if included as a whole. Alternatively, single elements can be added, such as additional properties and mapping those to other vocabulary elements of other vocabularies. First, one should review the created context against any prior requirements that may have been described: is all prospected content indeed included in the context? Second, the syntax should be verified with a JSON-LD validator, such as JSON-LD Playground to ensure that the context is free of errors and all URLs used are operational. Public administrations often need to share information about their services with other organisations and the public. To do this effectively, the data must be easy to understand and work seamlessly across different systems. However, public services are becoming more complex, which means we need to capture more details, concepts, and relationships to handle various use cases. The Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) provides a generic framework to describe public services in a machine-readable way. It helps public administrations share and organise information about services. However, sometimes CPSV-AP needs to be extended with new concepts or restrictions to address more general or specific use cases. For example, the terms Service and RequiredEvidence were introduced in CPSV-AP-NO to extend the CPSV-AP model such that it can fulfil the specific needs identified in Norway, where: Service allows for describing not only public services but also general ones, enabling the representation of services provided through partnerships or private organisations. RequiredEvidence provides a way to explicitly define the documentation or credentials needed to access a service, such as proof of address for health insurance registration. To make CPSV-AP more flexible and useful, creating a JSON-LD context is essential. JSON-LD helps structure the data so it can be easily shared and understood by different systems. This tutorial addresses the use case UC1.2, and will show how to create a JSON-LD context for an Application Profile that extends CPSV-AP with new concepts like Service and RequiredEvidence, which are defined by reusing concepts from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), following ideas from CPSV-AP-NO. By extending CPSV-AP and using JSON-LD, public administrations can better organise their data, making it easier to share and integrate across systems while supporting a wider range of use cases. Since CPSV-AP provides an existing JSON-LD context, we can import it in our own JSON-LD context using the @import statement. For example, in case of CPSV-AP version 3.2.0, the context can be directly reused like this: { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } } If a context that we can reuse does not exist, define the elements explicitly. For example, CPSV-AP uses specific terms such as PublicService and ContactPoint. These terms must be mapped to URIs. { \"@context\": { \"PublicService\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"ContactPoint\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/ContactPoint\" } } If a context needs to be extended, define the new elements explicitly. For example, if we need new terms (classes), such as Service and RequiredEvidence, which are not in CPSV-AP these terms must be mapped to URIs (the examples are inspired from CPSV-AP-NO) : { \"@context\": { \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"RequiredEvidence\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\" } } Once you’ve imported or defined the relevant terms, you need to structure your JSON-LD context to reflect the relationships between the classes and their properties. This allows you to describe public services and their details in a standardised and machine-readable format. Let’s look at an example where we define a Service and some of its key properties, such as contactPoint, description, name and hasRequiredEvidence. { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"Service.hasRequiredEvidence\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.description\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.name\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.contactPoint\": { \"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"@id\", \"@container\": \"@set\" } } } @context: Defines the mapping between terms (e.g., PublicService) and their corresponding IRIs. @container: Specifies how values are structured. For instance, @set: Explicitly defines a property as an array of values. It ensures that even if the data includes just one value, it will still be treated as an array by JSON-LD processors. This makes post-processing of JSON-LD documents easier as the data is always in array form, even if the array only contains a single value @id: Provides the unique identifier (IRI) for a term or property. @type: Specifies the type of a value. Commonly used for linking to classes or data types. @import: Imports another JSON-LD context, allowing reuse of its terms. After defining the context and structure, you can now describe an actual Service instance by referencing the terms you defined earlier. Let’s assume a public administration offers a service called \"Health Insurance Registration\". This service allows citizens to register for health insurance, which requires certain documents (evidence) to complete the process. Citizens might need to contact the administration for guidance, and the service details should be structured in a way that makes it easy to share and integrate across systems. To illustrate this, we’ve created a JSON-LD context representation of this service, highlighting The required evidence for registration (e.g., Proof of Address). The service’s name and description for clarity. Contact information for users who may need assistance. Try this in JSON-LD Playground here { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" } } When working with REST APIs, it is often beneficial to alias certain JSON-LD keywords for simpler or more consistent representations in client applications. For example, you might alias JSON-LD’s @id to url and @type to type to make the data more intuitive for API consumers, especially when working with legacy systems or client-side frameworks that use specific naming conventions. { \"@context\": { \"url\": \"@id\", \"type\": \"@type\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.name\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.description\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\" }, \"url\": \"http://example.com/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"type\": \"Service\", \"Service.name\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"Service.description\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\" } In this example: url is an alias for @id type is an alias for @type By aliasing these terms, the API responses are simplified and more familiar to the developers interacting with the service, especially if they are accustomed to a different JSON structure. To highlight the reuse of terms from existing CVs, we can import the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) context alongside the CPSV-AP context to gain access to business-related terms. This step ensures that you can use the additional terms from CBV, such as LegalEntity, Organisation, and ContactPoint, to enrich your Service descriptions. { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" }, { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\" } ] } Add CBV terms to enhance the description of the Service entity. { \"@context\": { \"Service.providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/legal#providedBy\", \"@type\": \"http://example.com/legal#LegalEntity\" }, \"LegalEntity\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity\" } } Use the extended properties to describe more aspects of Service instances. For example: { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\", { \"ex\": \"http://example.org/\" } ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"ex:providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.org/legalEntity/healthDepartment\", \"@type\": \"LegalEntity\" } } Use an online tool such as the JSON-LD Playground to validate JSON-LD context and make sure there are no errors. If the @import URLs for external contexts are incorrect or unavailable, the validation tool may display an error such as: \"Error loading remote context\" or \"Context could not be retrieved.\" { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://invalid-url/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } ] } These errors typically occur when the referenced context URL is malformed or unreachable, as shown in the following figure: Ensure that the @import URLs point to valid and accessible JSON-LD contexts. Verify the links in a browser or test them in a cURL command to ensure they return the correct JSON-LD data. Update the URLs to the correct ones.","title":"Create a new JSON-LD context definition","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"UC1.2-description","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/UC1.2-description.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Guideline to create a new JSON-LD context definition","hash":"sec:create-a-new-json-ld-context-definition","id":2},{"text":"Import or define elements","hash":"_import_or_define_elements","id":3},{"text":"Shape structure","hash":"_shape_structure","id":4},{"text":"Main shaping of the structure","hash":"_main_shaping_of_the_structure","id":5},{"text":"Improvements to the structure","hash":"_improvements_to_the_structure","id":6},{"text":"Review and validate","hash":"_review_and_validate","id":7},{"text":"UC 1.2 tutorial on creating JSON-LD context","hash":"sec:create-a-json-ld-definition","id":8},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":9},{"text":"Steps to create a JSON-LD context","hash":"_steps_to_create_a_json_ld_context","id":10},{"text":"Import or define elements:","hash":"_import_or_define_elements_2","id":11},{"text":"Shape the structure","hash":"_shape_the_structure","id":12},{"text":"Explanation of JSON-LD keywords used","hash":"_explanation_of_json_ld_keywords_used","id":13},{"text":"Example of a simple service instance","hash":"_example_of_a_simple_service_instance","id":14},{"text":"Example scenario","hash":"_example_scenario","id":15},{"text":"Aliasing keywords for API compatibility (REST API example)","hash":"_aliasing_keywords_for_api_compatibility_rest_api_example","id":16},{"text":"Example of aliasing keywords","hash":"_example_of_aliasing_keywords","id":17},{"text":"Extend the context by reusing terms from Core Vocabularies","hash":"_extend_the_context_by_reusing_terms_from_core_vocabularies","id":18},{"text":"Define additional properties from the Core Business Vocabulary","hash":"_define_additional_properties_from_the_core_business_vocabulary","id":19},{"text":"Map extended properties in a service instance:","hash":"_map_extended_properties_in_a_service_instance","id":20},{"text":"Final review and validation","hash":"_final_review_and_validation","id":21},{"text":"Error example:","hash":"_error_example","id":22},{"text":"How to fix:","hash":"_how_to_fix","id":23}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"Use Case UC2.1: Map an existing Ontology to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping between the terms of an existing ontology and the terms of Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping expressed in Semantic Web terminology (for example using rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, owl:sameAs properties), associating the terms in an existing ontology that defines relevant concepts in a given domain, to terms defined in one or more CVs. This activity is usually performed by a semantic engineer based on input received from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping associates the terms in an existing ontology, which defines relevant concepts within a specific domain, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. The result of the formal mapping can be used later by software engineers to build information exchange systems. Example: Mapping Core Person to Schema.org [map-cp2org], Core Business to Schema.org [map-cb2org], etc. Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing Ontology section. This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC2.1. In this section we adopt the definition from this paper of the following concepts: Ontology matching: the process of finding relationships or correspondences between entities of different ontologies. Ontology alignment: a set of correspondences between 2 or more ontologies, as outcome of ontology matching process. Ontology mapping: the oriented, or directed, version of an alignment, i.e., it maps the entities of one ontology to at most one entity of another ontology. To create an ontology alignment, the following steps need to be observed: Staging: defining the requirements Characterisation: defining source and target data and performing data analysis Reuse: discover, evaluate, and reuse existing alignments Matching: execute and evaluate matching Align and map: prepare, create the alignment, and render mappings Application: make the alignment available for use in applications This methodology has been used in mapping the Core Vocabularies to Schema.org. This work is available on the SEMIC GitHub repository dedicated to Semantic Mappings, and documented here. Next sections describe this methodology in more detail. This initial phase involves a comprehensive understanding of the project’s scope, identifying the specific goals of the mapping exercise, and the key requirements it must fulfil. Stakeholders collaborate to articulate the purpose of the ontology or data model alignment, setting clear objectives that will guide the entire process. Defining these requirements upfront ensures that subsequent steps are aligned with the mapping exercise overarching goals, stakeholder expectations and fitting the use cases. Inputs: Stakeholder knowledge, project goals, available resources, domain expertise. Outputs: Mapping project specification document comprising a defined mapping project scope and comprehensive list of requirements. In this stage, a thorough analysis of both source and target ontologies is conducted to ascertain their structures, vocabularies, and the semantics they encapsulate. This involves an in-depth examination of the conceptual frameworks, data representation languages, and any existing constraints within both models. Understanding the nuances of both the source and target is critical for identifying potential challenges and opportunities in the mapping process, ensuring that the alignment is both feasible and meaningful. The following is an indicative, but not exhaustive, list of aspects to consider in this analysis: specifications documentation, representation language and representation formats, deprecation mechanism, inheritance policy (single inheritance only or multiple inheritance are also allowed), natural language(s) used, label specification, label conventions, definition specification, definition conventions, version management and release cycles, etc. Inputs: Source and target ontologies, initial requirements, domain constraints. Outputs: Analysis reports comprising a comparative characterisation table, identified difficulties, risks and amenability assessments, selected source and target for mapping. In the ontology mapping lifecycle, the reuse stage is pivotal, facilitating the integration of pre-existing alignments into the project’s workflow. Following the initial characterisation, this stage entails discovery and a rigorous evaluation of available alignments against the project’s defined requirements. These requirements are instrumental in appraising whether an existing alignment can be directly adopted, necessitates modifications for reuse, or if a new alignment should be constructed from the ground up. Ontology alignments are often expressed in Alignment Format (AF) or EDOAL. An example statement in a Turtle file representing an ontology alignment (taken from the Core Business Vocabulary to Schema.org alignment), could look something like this: a align:Cell; align:entity1 ; align:entity2 ; align:relation \"=\"; align:measure \"1\"^^xsd:float; owl:annotatedProperty owl:equivalentClass; sssom:mapping_justification semapv:MappingReview . The outcome of this stage splits into three distinct pathways: direct reuse of alignments that are immediately applicable, adaptive reuse where existing alignments provide a partial fit and serve as a basis for refinement (i.e. we can improve certain alignment statements, or add new statements in the alignment map), and the initiation of a new alignment when existing resources are not suitable. This structured approach to reuse optimises resource utilisation, promotes efficiency, and tailors the mapping process to the project’s unique objectives. Inputs: repository of existing alignments (for the source and target ontologies), evaluation criteria based on requirements. Outputs: Assessment report on existing alignments, decisions on reuse, adaptation, or creation of a new alignment. This section delves into automatic and semi-automatic approaches to finding the alignment candidates. However, in cases of small vocabularies and ontologies fully manual efforts are likely more efficient. Utilising both automated tools and manual expertise, this phase focuses on identifying potential correspondences between entities in the source and target models. The matching process may employ various methodologies, including semantic similarity measures, pattern recognition, or lexical analysis, to propose candidate alignments. These candidates are then critically evaluated for their accuracy, relevance, and completeness, ensuring they meet the predefined requirements and are logically sound. This stage is delineated into three main activities: planning, execution, and evaluation. In the planning activity, the approach to ontology matching is meticulously strategised. The planning encompasses selecting appropriate algorithms and methods, fine-tuning parameters, determining thresholds for similarity and identity functions, and setting evaluative criteria. These preparations are informed by a thorough understanding of the project’s requirements and the outcomes of previous reuse evaluations. Numerous well-established ontology matching algorithms have been extensively reviewed in the literature (for in-depth discussions, see paper). The main classes of ontology matching techniques are listed below in the order of their relevance to this handbook: Terminological techniques draw on the textual content within ontologies, such as entity labels and comments, employing methods from natural language processing and information retrieval, including string distances and statistical text analysis. Structural techniques analyse the relationships and constraints between ontology entities, using methods like graph matching to explore the topology of ontology structures. Semantic techniques apply formal logic and inference to deduce the implications of proposed alignments, aiding in the expansion of alignments or detection of conflicts. Extensional techniques compare entity sets, or instances, potentially involving analysis of shared resources across ontologies to establish similarity measures. Following planning, the execution activity implements the chosen matchers. Automated or semi-automated tools are deployed to carry out the matching process, resulting in a list of candidate correspondences. This list typically includes suggested links between elements of the source and target ontologies, each with an associated confidence level computed by the algorithms. EDOAL, a representation framework for expressing such correspondences, is commonly utilised to encapsulate these potential alignments. Finally, in the evaluation activity, the candidate correspondences are rigorously assessed for their suitability. The evaluation measures the candidates against the project’s specific needs, scrutinising their accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the predefined requirements. This assessment ensures that only the most suitable correspondences are carried forward for the creation of an alignment, thereby upholding the integrity and logical soundness of the mapping process. Tools: Tools such as Silk can be used in this stage. Inputs: Matcher configurations, additional resources (if any), candidate correspondences from previous matching iterations. Outputs: Generated candidate correspondences, evaluation reports, finalised list of potential alignments. Following the identification of suitable matches, this step involves the formal creation of the alignment and the rendering (generation) of specific mappings between the source and target models. This phase encompasses preparation, creation, and rendering activities that solidify the relationships between ontology entities into a coherent alignment and actionable mappings. The resulting alignment is then documented, detailing the rationale, methods used, and any assumptions made during the mapping process. The alignment process should be considered as part of the governance of a vocabulary or ontology that would include engaging communication with third parties to validate the alignment. Furthermore, the process has technical implications that should be evaluated upfront such as the machine interpretation and execution of the mapping. Preparation involves stakeholder consensus on the Alignment Plan. This plan guides stakeholders through the systematic refinement of candidate correspondences, considering not only the relevance of the matches, but also the type of relationship between the elements. This plan might include the removal of irrelevant correspondences or strategic amendments to existing relationships. The chosen candidate correspondences are those that have been determined to be an adequate starting point for the alignment. The type of asset—be it an ontology, controlled list, or data shape—dictates the nature of the relationship that can be rendered from the alignment. The table [below] elucidates potential relationship types that can be established: Relation / Element type Property Concept Class Individual = owl:equivalentProperty; owl:sameAs skos:exactMatch; skos:closeMatch owl:equivalentClass; owl:sameAs owl:sameAs > skos:narrowMatch < rdfs:subPropertyOf skos:broadMatch rdfs:subClassOf % owl:propertyDisjointWith owl:disjointWith owl:differentFrom instanceOf rdf:type skos:broadMatch; rdf:type rdf:type rdf:type hasInstance skos:narrowMatch This table is indicative of the variety of semantic connections that can be realised, ranging from equivalence and subclass relations to disjointness and type instantiation. This nuanced approach to the preparation stage is essential in ensuring that the eventual alignment and rendered mapping accurately represent the semantic intricacies of the relationships defined in the project scope, thereby fulfilling the project’s defined requirements. The Creation step is the execution of the Alignment Plan, entailing the selection and refinement of correspondences. This activity involves human intervention to select and refine those correspondences for transitioning into a deliberate alignment. The selection is conducted manually according to the project’s objectives. Rendering translates the refined alignment into a mapping—a directed version that can be interpreted and executed by software agents. This process is straightforward, producing a machine-executable artefact. Most often this is a simple export of the alignment statements from the editing tool or the materialisation of the alignment in a triple store. Multiple renderings may be created from the same alignment, accommodating the need for various formalisms. Tools: Tools such as VocBench3 can be used in this stage, but more generic ones, such as MS Excel or Google Sheets spreadsheets, can be used as well. Inputs: Evaluated candidate correspondences, stakeholders' amendment plans, requirements for the formalism of the mapping. Outputs: Created alignment and mapping, alignment amendment strategy, stored versions in an alignment repository. The final stage focuses on operationalising the created alignment, ensuring it is accessible and usable by applications that require semantic interoperability between the mapped models. This involves publishing the alignment in a standardised, machine-readable format and integrating it within ontology management or data integration tools. Additionally, mechanisms for maintaining, updating, and governing the alignment are established, facilitating its long-term utility and relevance. Moreover, this stage involves the creation of maintenance protocols to preserve the alignment’s relevance over time. This includes procedures for regular updates in response to changes in ontology structures or evolving requirements, as well as governance mechanisms to oversee these adaptations. As the mapping is applied, new insights may emerge, prompting discussions within the stakeholder community about potential refinements or the development of a new iteration of the mapping. The dynamic nature of data sources means that the application stage is both an endpoint, as well as a starting point for continuous improvement. Some processes may be automated to enhance efficiency, such as the monitoring of ontologies for changes that would necessitate updates to the mapping. Inputs: Finalised mappings, application context, feedback mechanisms. Outputs: Applied mappings in use, insights from application, triggers for potential updates, governance actions for lifecycle management.

Such an artefact can be of different nature both according to their interoperability layer (ranging from vocabulary and ontology, to data shape and data schema) and also according to their abstraction level (ranging from upper layer, through domain layer to application layer). Note: Since this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into more concrete use cases that focus on specific data models.

Such activity can be done by semantic engineers, based on input from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping is usually used as the basis for the formal mapping. The conceptual mapping can be a simple correspondence table associating the JSON data model elements defined in an JSON schema, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies.

Understanding this framework allows stakeholders to use the semantic data specifications effectively and align expectations and practices ensuring consistent and effective communication. The structure of the section is methodically organised into several subsections, each focusing on a different element of semantic data specifications. It begins with a broad overview of the specifications, and establishes what the artefacts are. Then progressively it narrows down to specific artefacts types, namely data models and documentation. Further subsections explore data models interaction across different layers of data interoperability, and semantic data specification types. This sequential approach helps readers build a comprehensive understanding from general concepts to specific explanations. Semantic data specifications are composite standards designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability among diverse systems, characterised by their descriptive and prescriptive nature. These specifications are realised through a suite of artefacts that are harmoniously interrelated and address different interoperability scopes and use cases—ranging from semantic to technical concerns. The artefacts are fashioned to be both machine-readable and human-understandable, ensuring consistent interpretation and utilisation. Figure 1 depicts a conceptualisation of how various components that make up a complete semantic data specification interconnect. At the top of the diagram is the \"Semantic data specification\" indicating its overarching role. It serves a \"Purpose/Goal\" which frames various specific \"Concern/Need\". The semantic data specification comprises various \"Artefacts\" denoting the different elements that make up the specification. Figure 1 Beneath this, the framework branches into two main types of artefacts: \"Data models” and \"Documentation\". The most relevant data models are \"Vocabulary\", \"Ontology\", \"Data shape\" and \"UML Class model\". Each data model is expressed in a \"Modelling language\" appropriate for the concern or the need addressed. The next section introduces the relevant artefact types. Integral to semantic data specifications is the intrinsic consistency and coherence among the artefacts. Each represents a facet of the same domain knowledge, but is tailored to address specific concerns—such as human understandability, semantic underpinning, formal definition, and data serialisation (addressed in the next section). This alignment ensures that each artefact, while distinct in function, contributes to a unified view of the domain, making the entire specification accessible and actionable. Such consistency is pivotal in maintaining semantic integrity, leading to robust technical interoperability and seamless information exchange. Each artefact, while unique in its form and function, represents different facets of the same domain. They are harmonised, yet distinct, with each created to address specific concerns, such as: Semantic Underpinning: The semantic data specification needs to encapsulate formally the domain knowledge, capturing the essence of its concepts and the possible relationships between them. Ontologies play a key role here, offering a structured and logical framework that lays out the domain knowledge in a way that is both comprehensive and actionable. Formal Definition: Using formal languages such as OWL or RDFS for semantic representation enables precise interpretation and inference over the ontologies and instance data. Moreover, data shapes facilitate data structuring on top of the ontology, defining precise constraints and conditions under which the data can be instantiated. This formalisation ensures that the data adheres to the standard, facilitating automated validation and processing. Human Understandability: This aspect ensures that individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, can comprehend and engage with the semantic data specifications. The reference documentation along with visual representation of UML class diagrams brings clarity and guidance for human users to grasp the meaning of the semantic data specification and its intended use. Visual Representation: The semantic data specification is much easier to understand once it is presented in a visual format. Typically class diagrams are the most suitable to encapsulate the concepts and the relations between boosting significantly comprehension. Data Serialisation: The technical artefacts of the specification, such as information exchange data models for various serialisation formats (e.g., JSON-LD, XML), ensure that the data can be correctly serialised, deserialized, and exchanged across systems and platforms. They cater for the technical requirements of data transport (and storage). The coherence among these artefacts ensures that despite their different purposes and audiences, they all align in their representation of the domain knowledge. This alignment guarantees that whether a stakeholder is interpreting the model conceptually, engaging with it through documentation, or implementing it technically, they are presented with a unified and consistent view of the semantic data specification. This cohesive approach is pivotal for maintaining semantic integrity across various applications and systems. The key data model artefacts of a specification include: Vocabulary: An established list of preferred terms that signify concepts or relationships within a domain of discourse. All terms must have an unambiguous and non-redundant definition. Optionally it may include synonyms, notes and their translation to multiple languages. It is represented informally, for example, as a spreadsheet or SKOS thesaurus. Ontology: An ontology is a formal, machine-readable specification of a conceptual model [Harpring2016]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming using URIs, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse, effectively enabling a shared and common understanding of data [wiki-onto]. It is usually expressed in OWL and RDFS. Data Shape: Constraints or patterns that describe how instantiations of an ontology should be structured. Data shape artefacts can be used not only to ensure that RDF data adheres to predefined structure and validation rules, but also as a blueprint for information exchange data models, preserving semantics and ensuring consistency in data exchange. It is usually expressed in SHACL. Controlled list (of values): A value vocabulary used to express concepts or values in instance data. It defines resources (such as instances of topics, languages, countries, or authors) that are used as values for elements in metadata records. Typically, the value vocabularies serve as reference data and constitute \"building blocks\" with which metadata records can be populated. UML class model: A static structure UML model and associated diagrams that describes the structure of data by showing the classes, their attributes, and the relationships among objects. It may include documentation, description and various annotations. Such data model shall be conformant to the SEMIC style guide in order to fit for purpose of semantic data specifications. Human-readable documentation: This artefact elucidates the specifications for stakeholders of varying business and technical backgrounds, detailing the structure, intent, and practical application of the semantic data specification. Beyond these foundational elements, semantic data specifications may also incorporate artefacts designed for the technical interoperability layer called information exchange data models. They define and describe in a technology-specific manner the structure and content of information that is exchanged between organisations in a specific information exchange context. They detail the syntax, structure, data types, and constraints necessary for effective data communication between systems. These artefacts are necessary to realise the technical interoperability. If the chosen technology for exchange is of semantic nature (e.g. RDF), then a perfect syntax-semantics conflation is readily available through ontologies and data shapes. Otherwise, if a more traditional technology is selected due to popularity or legacy reasons, such as XML/XSD or JSON, then a mapping that acts as a syntax-semantics interface needs to be established, binding the physical model and the semantic specification. These can include various information exchange data models like: JSON-LD context definitions: Facilitating the mapping of JSON to RDF linked data representation. XML Schemas (XSD): Defining the structure and validating the constraints of XML documents. API (Component) Specifications (REST, WSDL or GraphQL): Outlining the request, response and parameters for web-based data access and manipulation [swagger]. Such components are generally reusable blocks to facilitate reusability and maintenance of APIs. In the framework depicted [below], the artefacts are strategically organised within the semantic and technical interoperability layers, with each layer focusing on different but complementary aspects of data interoperability. As it can be seen, some artefacts belong to the semantic layer, and others to the technical layer, while the data shapes are present in both, according to their multipurpose nature. The Semantic Layer encapsulates artefacts associated with the conceptual understanding of data. It is focused on defining the vocabulary and ontology that provide the foundational elements for data interoperability. These artefacts ensure that the meaning of data is clearly defined and shared across different systems, establishing the semantic rules that govern data exchange. The Technical Layer is concerned with the practical aspects of data handling, such as data representation formats, communication protocols, and interface specifications. Artefacts in this layer address the technical requirements necessary for data to be physically exchanged and processed by information systems. Documentation and UML Class models are depicted as orthogonal to these layers, as they facilitate human understanding and transcend the semantic-technical divide. These artefacts provide clarity and guidance, helping stakeholders visualise and comprehend the data structures and relationships without being confined to the constraints of either layer. We can discern three interconnected layers each representing a different level of abstraction in semantic data specifications. The arrangement signifies the gradation from the abstract to the specific. The Upper Layer accommodates the most abstract form of semantic data specifications. These specifications are context-free, meaning that they are not tied to any particular domain or application, and can be universally applied across various fields. These semantic data specifications, provide the broadest concepts that can be reused in numerous contexts. Here we generally find upper level ontologies (defining highly abstract foundational concepts such as “object”, “property”, “event” etc.), but also the core semantic data specifications, which, although more specific, can also be applied across multiple domains. The main objective of the Core Vocabularies is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context [sem-sg-wsds]. Upper ontologies and core semantic data specifications serve as a scaffolding for domain ontologies, offering a hierarchy where the more general terms of the upper ontology act as superclasses (in some cases even as metaclasses) to the more specific classes of domain ontologies. This arrangement supports the structuring and integration of knowledge by providing common reference points that enhance understanding and data processing across different systems. Notable examples: Upper ontologies: DOLCE, Gist, BFO, etc. Core Vocabularies: Dublin Core Terms, Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), The Organization Ontology (ORG), European Legislation Identifier (ELI) The Domain Layer sits at the intersection of the upper and application layers. It contains specifications that are more specific than the upper layer, but not as narrowly focused as the application layer. The semantic data specifications in this layer incorporate concepts relevant to a domain or sector (e.g. the justice domain, the public procurement domain, the healthcare domain) and represent the most specific knowledge from the perspective of that domain. The domain layer is visually overlapped by both the upper and application layers, symbolising that some domain-specific semantic data specifications can inherit traits from, or lend characteristics to, both the more abstract upper layer and the more concrete application layer. Notable examples: DCAT-AP eProcurement Ontology The Application Layer is the most concrete and context-specific, containing semantic data specifications tailored for particular applications or families of applications. Application Profiles are detailed in constraints and data shapes, addressing explicit needs and constraints of a specific system or use case, and generally provide precise technical artefacts that can be used in data exchange. Notable examples: GeoDCAT-AP BRegDCAT-AP Stat-DCAT-AP Terminological Clarification: The level of abstraction pertaining to a semantic data specification—be it core, domain, or application—can be applied as an adjective to describe its constituent artefacts. Thus, for a \"core semantic data specification\" the included components would be referred to as \"core vocabulary\", \"core ontology\", \"core data shape\" and \"core exchange data model\" and so on. Similarly, for a \"domain semantic data specification,\" the elements would be denoted as \"domain vocabulary\", \"domain ontology\", \"domain data shape\" and \"domain exchange data model\", respectively. In the semantic data specification framework depicted [below], the documentation artefacts are organised into three distinct types, as illustrated in Figure 2, each catering to different aspects of user engagement with the data model. For effective documentation practices, we recommend principles laid out in the Diátaxis framework, which is a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users [dtx]. It identifies four distinct needs (learning, understanding, consulting reference, achieving goals), and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, handbooks, reference documentation and textbooks. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs. In addition, we mention the Diagrams, which are usually embedded into documents, to underline the importance of visual depiction of models and to recognise them as distinct artefacts from the models (e.g. UML class diagrams). In the context of semantic data specifications we find relevant the following documentation kinds. Figure 2 The Handbook (or usage manual) is a how-to guide and serves as an introductory reading to users new to the semantic data specification. It can also take the form of a tutorial to achieve predefined goals. It typically comprises use-case descriptions, examples and practical, step-by-step instructions designed to help users acquire the necessary skills to effectively use the semantic data specification. Examples: This document The Textbook (or explanatory manual) is an explanatory type of documentation and focuses on deepening the users’ understanding of the underlying concepts and principles incorporated into the semantic data specification. It aims to inform cognition, enhancing the user’s theoretical knowledge and conceptual insight, which is critical for those looking to gain a more profound grasp of the specification’s rationale, decisions, strengths and limitations. Examples: SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] The Reference document is a technical type of documentation and provides concise, detailed information about various elements of the semantic data specification. It serves users who are already familiar with the theoretical framework and need to apply their knowledge to specific tasks. This artefact is a go-to resource for factual and objective data about the semantic specifications, such as semantics, syntax, entities, properties, relationships, and constraints within the data model. Examples: reference documents for Core Person [cpv], Core Business [cbv], etc. These documentation artefacts are designed to collectively support the user’s journey from novice to expert within the semantic data specification domain. The Usage Manual aids in initial skill acquisition, the Explanatory Textbook supports deeper learning and understanding, and the Reference Documentation acts as a reliable resource for informed application and use. Together, they ensure that users at different stages of learning and practice have access to the appropriate materials to meet their needs.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"conceptual-framework","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/conceptual-framework.html","titles":[{"text":"Conceptual framework","hash":"_conceptual_framework","id":1},{"text":"Semantic data specifications","hash":"sec:semantic-data-specifications","id":2},{"text":"Artefacts","hash":"sec:artefacts","id":3},{"text":"Data models","hash":"sec:data-models","id":4},{"text":"Artefacts across interoperability layers","hash":"sec:artefacts-across-interoperability-layers","id":5},{"text":"Data specification types","hash":"sec:data-specification-types","id":6},{"text":"Documentation","hash":"sec:documentation","id":7}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"Creating an XSD schema for the Core Vocabulary involves defining the structure, data types, and relationships for the elements of the CBV, ensuring interoperability between systems. This tutorial follows the methodology outlined for Use Case UC1.1: \"Create a New XSD Schema,\" showing how to design and create an XSD schema that integrates terms from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). This step-by-step guide focuses on the essential stages of the schema creation process, ensuring that the elements from CBV are correctly imported, the document structure is shaped, and all constraints are applied. To recap the process, we first will import or define elements, shape the structure with patterns, define complex types, and finalise the schema. In XML schema development, managing imports and namespaces is crucial to ensure that elements from external vocabularies are reused and integrated consistently. This step ensures that the schema obtains semantics, will be reusable, and is correctly aligned with the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). For example, CBV comes with its own XSD schema, the following import statement imports all definitions related to CBV elements. The following example shows how to import the CBV into your XSD schema, which is explained afterward: : The element that imports the CBV schema to make its terms available in your schema. namespace=\"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/\": Defines the namespace of the CBV. schemaLocation=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/XML-schema/main/models/CoreVoc_Business/CoreVoc_Business.xsd\"\": Points to the location of the CBV schema file on the Web. If no XSD schema is provided by the Core Vocabulary, you must define these terms manually within your own schema. These new elements need to adhere to the Core Vocabulary’s namespace to maintain consistency. For example, the LegalEntity element could be defined as follows if no XSD is provided for it: Make sure you declare the correct namespace (e.g., http://example.com/) for all these custom elements. At this stage, we focus on structuring the XML document using appropriate XML Schema Design Patterns. The Venetian Blind and Garden of Eden patterns are two methods for organizing the schema. In the Venetian Blind pattern, there is one primary global element, and all other elements are nested inside it. This approach is ideal when a central entity, like LegalEntity, serves as the entry point, as seen in CBV. This pattern fits well with API design, where you typically request information about a central concept (such as LegalEntity), and the response includes nested elements like LegalName and RegisteredAddress, all organised under the main entity. Here’s an example, where LegalEntity serves as the main entry point: In this example: LegalEntity is the global entry point. It uses LegalEntityType, which contains various properties such as LegalName and RegisteredAddress. In the Garden of Eden pattern, there are multiple entry points in the XML document. This is more flexible and is suitable when no central class is inherently the main starting point.. Core Business Vocabularies (CBVs) often use this pattern. While LegalEntity may be central, the pattern allows reusing properties even if specific classes aren’t directly used. For example, you could start with a class like Identifier instead of LegalEntity. For instance, both LegalEntity and Organization can serve as root elements in the XML schema: After importing or defining the basic elements and structuring your XML document with patterns, the next step in creating an XSD schema is to define complex types. Complex types are used to represent business entities that contain multiple properties or relationships. For CBV, these types often model entities like LegalEntity or Organization, which have both simple and complex elements. For example, the LegalEntityType and OrganizationType, as follows. A LegalEntity might contain multiple child elements, such as LegalName modelled as a simple string, RegisteredAddress (also a complex type), and other related elements. Here’s how LegalEntityType is defined: Note: The sawsdl:modelReference annotation is used to link the element to an external concept, providing semantic context by associating the element with a specific vocabulary or ontology. Similar to the LegalEntityType complex type, the OrganizationType defines a business entity with multiple properties and relationships. However, for Organization, we define it as a complex type that contains hierarchical relationships, such as HeadOf and MemberOf. This allows Organization to contain members and potentially sub-organizations, thus creating a flexible representation of organizational structures. It’s important to note that in this context, LegalEntityType is defined as an extension of FormalOrganizationType, which, in turn, extends OrganizationType. Adding annotations and documentation to each complex type and element helps to clarify their purpose and improve the readability of the schema. For instance: A self-employed person, company, or organization that has legal rights and obligations. Finally, test your new schema by validating sample XML documents using XML validation tools (e.g.: XMLValidation tool) to ensure that the schema is syntactically correct and works as expected. The Core Business Vocabularies (CBV) follow several best practices and validation rules to maintain consistency, clarity, and reusability across schemas. These rules include naming conventions, documentation standards, and structural rules. To ensure schema compliance, the Schematron rules provide automated checks. These rules cover key aspects such as type definitions, element declarations, metadata, and more. The detailed list of rules can be found here. You can execute the rules using the provided build.xml file, which leverages Apache Ant. The process validates the schema against the Schematron rules and generates HTML reports for easy inspection.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"create xsd for cv","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/create%20xsd%20for%20cv.html","titles":[{"text":"UC1.1: Tutorial on creating an XSD schema for Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)","hash":"_uc1_1_tutorial_on_creating_an_xsd_schema_for_core_business_vocabulary_cbv","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1:Import or Define Elements","hash":"_phase_1import_or_define_elements","id":2},{"text":"Managing Imports and Namespaces","hash":"_managing_imports_and_namespaces","id":3},{"text":"Define elements","hash":"_define_elements","id":4},{"text":"Phase 2: Shape XML Document Structure with Patterns","hash":"_phase_2_shape_xml_document_structure_with_patterns","id":5},{"text":"Venetian Blind Pattern","hash":"_venetian_blind_pattern","id":6},{"text":"Garden of Eden Pattern","hash":"_garden_of_eden_pattern","id":7},{"text":"Define Complex Types","hash":"_define_complex_types","id":8},{"text":"Finalising the XSD Schema","hash":"_finalising_the_xsd_schema","id":9},{"text":"Phase 3: Validation and Best Practices","hash":"_phase_3_validation_and_best_practices","id":10},{"text":"Schematron Validation Rules","hash":"_schematron_validation_rules","id":11},{"text":"Running the Validation","hash":"_running_the_validation","id":12}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"Public administrations often need to share information about their services with other organisations and the public. To do this effectively, the data must be easy to understand and work seamlessly across different systems. However, public services are becoming more complex, which means we need to capture more details, concepts, and relationships to handle various use cases. The Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) provides a generic framework to describe public services in a machine-readable way. It helps public administrations share and organise information about services. However, sometimes CPSV-AP needs to be extended with new concepts or restrictions to address more general or specific use cases. For example, the terms Service and RequiredEvidence were introduced in CPSV-AP-NO to extend the CPSV-AP model such that it can fulfil the specific needs identified in Norway, where: Service allows for describing not only public services but also general ones, enabling the representation of services provided through partnerships or private organisations. RequiredEvidence provides a way to explicitly define the documentation or credentials needed to access a service, such as proof of address for health insurance registration. To make CPSV-AP more flexible and useful, creating a JSON-LD context is essential. JSON-LD helps structure the data so it can be easily shared and understood by different systems. This tutorial addresses the use case UC1.2, and will show how to create a JSON-LD context for an Application Profile that extends CPSV-AP with new concepts like Service and RequiredEvidence, which are defined by reusing concepts from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), following ideas from CPSV-AP-NO. By extending CPSV-AP and using JSON-LD, public administrations can better organise their data, making it easier to share and integrate across systems while supporting a wider range of use cases. Since CPSV-AP provides an existing JSON-LD context, we can import it in our own JSON-LD context using the @import statement. For example, in case of CPSV-AP version 3.2.0, the context can be directly reused like this: { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } } If a context that we can reuse does not exist, define the elements explicitly. For example, CPSV-AP uses specific terms such as PublicService and ContactPoint. These terms must be mapped to URIs. { \"@context\": { \"PublicService\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"ContactPoint\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/ContactPoint\" } } If a context needs to be extended, define the new elements explicitly. For example, if we need new terms (classes), such as Service and RequiredEvidence, which are not in CPSV-AP these terms must be mapped to URIs (the examples are inspired from CPSV-AP-NO) : { \"@context\": { \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"RequiredEvidence\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\" } } Once you’ve imported or defined the relevant terms, you need to structure your JSON-LD context to reflect the relationships between the classes and their properties. This allows you to describe public services and their details in a standardised and machine-readable format. Let’s look at an example where we define a Service and some of its key properties, such as contactPoint, description, name and hasRequiredEvidence. { \"@context\": { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"Service\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#Service\", \"Service.hasRequiredEvidence\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/cpsvap#RequiredEvidence\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.description\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.name\": { \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\", \"@container\": \"@set\" }, \"Service.contactPoint\": { \"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"@id\", \"@container\": \"@set\" } } } @context: Defines the mapping between terms (e.g., PublicService) and their corresponding IRIs. @container: Specifies how values are structured. For instance, @set: Explicitly defines a property as an array of values. It ensures that even if the data includes just one value, it will still be treated as an array by JSON-LD processors. This makes post-processing of JSON-LD documents easier as the data is always in array form, even if the array only contains a single value @id: Provides the unique identifier (IRI) for a term or property. @type: Specifies the type of a value. Commonly used for linking to classes or data types. @import: Imports another JSON-LD context, allowing reuse of its terms. After defining the context and structure, you can now describe an actual Service instance by referencing the terms you defined earlier. Let’s assume a public administration offers a service called \"Health Insurance Registration\". This service allows citizens to register for health insurance, which requires certain documents (evidence) to complete the process. Citizens might need to contact the administration for guidance, and the service details should be structured in a way that makes it easy to share and integrate across systems. To illustrate this, we’ve created a JSON-LD context representation of this service, highlighting The required evidence for registration (e.g., Proof of Address). The service’s name and description for clarity. Contact information for users who may need assistance. Try this in JSON-LD Playground here { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" } } When working with REST APIs, it is often beneficial to alias certain JSON-LD keywords for simpler or more consistent representations in client applications. For example, you might alias JSON-LD’s @id to url and @type to type to make the data more intuitive for API consumers, especially when working with legacy systems or client-side frameworks that use specific naming conventions. { \"@context\": { \"url\": \"@id\", \"type\": \"@type\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.name\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\", \"Service\": \"http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService\", \"Service.description\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\" }, \"url\": \"http://example.com/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"type\": \"Service\", \"Service.name\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"Service.description\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\" } In this example: url is an alias for @id type is an alias for @type By aliasing these terms, the API responses are simplified and more familiar to the developers interacting with the service, especially if they are accustomed to a different JSON structure. To highlight the reuse of terms from existing CVs, we can import the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) context alongside the CPSV-AP context to gain access to business-related terms. This step ensures that you can use the additional terms from CBV, such as LegalEntity, Organisation, and ContactPoint, to enrich your Service descriptions. { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" }, { \"@import\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\" } ] } Add CBV terms to enhance the description of the Service entity. { \"@context\": { \"Service.providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.com/legal#providedBy\", \"@type\": \"http://example.com/legal#LegalEntity\" }, \"LegalEntity\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity\" } } Use the extended properties to describe more aspects of Service instances. For example: { \"@context\": [ \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP/master/releases/3.2.0/context/cpsv-ap.jsonld\", \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary/master/releases/2.2.0/context/core-business-ap.jsonld\", { \"ex\": \"http://example.org/\" } ], \"@id\": \"http://example.org/service/healthInsuranceRegistration\", \"@type\": \"PublicService\", \"PublicService.name\": { \"@value\": \"Health Insurance Registration\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"PublicService.description\": { \"@value\": \"A service for registering for health insurance.\", \"@language\": \"en\" }, \"ex:providedBy\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.org/legalEntity/healthDepartment\", \"@type\": \"LegalEntity\" } } Use an online tool such as the JSON-LD Playground to validate JSON-LD context and make sure there are no errors. If the @import URLs for external contexts are incorrect or unavailable, the validation tool may display an error such as: \"Error loading remote context\" or \"Context could not be retrieved.\" { \"@context\": [ { \"@import\": \"https://invalid-url/cpsv-ap.jsonld\" } ] } These errors typically occur when the referenced context URL is malformed or unreachable, as shown in the following figure: Ensure that the @import URLs point to valid and accessible JSON-LD contexts. Verify the links in a browser or test them in a cURL command to ensure they return the correct JSON-LD data. Update the URLs to the correct ones.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"creating JSON-LD context (UC 1.2)","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/creating%20JSON-LD%20context%20(UC%201.2).html","titles":[{"text":"UC 1.2 tutorial on creating JSON-LD context","hash":"_uc_1_2_tutorial_on_creating_json_ld_context","id":1},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":2},{"text":"Steps to create a JSON-LD context","hash":"_steps_to_create_a_json_ld_context","id":3},{"text":"Import or define elements:","hash":"_import_or_define_elements","id":4},{"text":"Shape the structure","hash":"_shape_the_structure","id":5},{"text":"Explanation of JSON-LD keywords used","hash":"_explanation_of_json_ld_keywords_used","id":6},{"text":"Example of a simple service instance","hash":"_example_of_a_simple_service_instance","id":7},{"text":"Example scenario","hash":"_example_scenario","id":8},{"text":"Aliasing keywords for API compatibility (REST API example)","hash":"_aliasing_keywords_for_api_compatibility_rest_api_example","id":9},{"text":"Example of aliasing keywords","hash":"_example_of_aliasing_keywords","id":10},{"text":"Extend the context by reusing terms from Core Vocabularies","hash":"_extend_the_context_by_reusing_terms_from_core_vocabularies","id":11},{"text":"Define additional properties from the Core Business Vocabulary","hash":"_define_additional_properties_from_the_core_business_vocabulary","id":12},{"text":"Map extended properties in a service instance:","hash":"_map_extended_properties_in_a_service_instance","id":13},{"text":"Final review and validation","hash":"_final_review_and_validation","id":14},{"text":"Error example:","hash":"_error_example","id":15},{"text":"How to fix:","hash":"_how_to_fix","id":16}]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"In the vast and diverse landscape of knowledge representation and data modelling, sources of knowledge are articulated through various means, each adopting its distinct methodology for expression. This diversity manifests not only in the choice of technology and representation languages, but also in the vocabularies used and the specific models created. Such heterogeneity, while enriching, introduces significant challenges for semantic interoperability—the ability of different systems to understand and use the information seamlessly across various contexts. The idea of unifying this rich spectrum of knowledge under a single model and a single representation language, though conceptually appealing, is pragmatically unfeasible and, arguably, undesirable. The diversity of knowledge sources is not merely a by-product of historical development, but a reflection of the varied domains, perspectives, and requirements these sources serve. To navigate this complexity, a more nuanced approach is required—one that seeks to establish connections across models without imposing uniformity. This is where the concepts of ontology matching and the broader spectrum of model alignment methodologies come into play. Moreover, the matching endeavour encompasses not only ontological artefacts, vocabularies and application profiles, but also various technical artefacts—ranging from data shapes defined in SHACL or ShEx, XSD schemas for XML, to JSON Schemas for JSON data. Each of these artefacts represents a different facet of information modelling and knowledge representation. Thus, mapping in this broader sense involves creating links between these semantic and technical artefacts and Core Vocabularies. The past couple decades have witnessed extensive efforts in ontology and attendant model matching, resulting in a plethora of tools, methods, and technologies aimed at enhancing semantic interoperability. These endeavours underscore the vast landscape of potential strategies available for matching. These strategies range from conceptual methodologies that explore the semantic congruence and contextual relevance of entities and relationships, to formal methodologies that operationalise these conceptual mappings as technical data transformation rules. It is important to acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all method; instead, the field offers a spectrum of approaches suited to various needs and contexts. The subsequent sections will describe the specific methodologies of matching—both conceptual and formal—and thereby providing a blueprint for navigating and bridging the world of semantic and technical artefacts, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions that best suit their interoperability needs.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"description-map-model","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/description-map-model.html","titles":[{"text":"How to map existing data models","hash":"_how_to_map_existing_data_models","id":1}]},"31":{"id":31,"text":"Alternative names: AP, context-specific semantic data specification Definition: Semantic data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context.

It serves as a practical blueprint for implementing an application profile in specific data exchange contexts. Additional information: An ontology and an exchange data model serve distinct yet complementary roles across different abstraction levels within data management systems. While a Data Schema specifies the technical structure for storing and exchanging data, primarily concerned with the syntactical and structural aspects of data, it is typically articulated using metamodel standards such as JSON Schema and XML Schema. In contrast, ontologies and data shapes operate at a higher conceptual level, outlining the knowledge and relational dynamics within a particular domain without delving into the specifics of data storage or structural implementations. Although a Data Schema can embody certain elements of an ontology or application profile—particularly attributes related to data structure and cardinalities necessary for data exchange—it does not encapsulate the complete semantics of the domain as expressed in an ontology. Thus, while exchange data models are essential for the technical realisation of data storage and exchange, they do not replace the broader, semantic understanding provided by ontologies. The interplay between these layers ensures that data schemas contribute to a holistic data management strategy by providing the necessary structure and constraints for data exchange, while ontologies offer the overarching semantic framework that guides the meaningful interpretation and utilisation of data across systems. Together, they facilitate a structured yet semantically rich data ecosystem conducive to advanced data interoperability and effective communication.

To create a new XSD schema, the following main steps need to be carried out: Import or define elements Shape structure with patterns Validation When working with XML schemas, particularly in relation to semantic artefacts like ontologies or data shapes, managing the imports and namespaces are vital considerations that ensure clarity, reusability, and proper integration of various data models. When a core vocabulary has defined an associated XSD schema, it is not only easy but also advisable to directly import this schema using the xsd:import statement. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the core vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. The imported elements are then employed in the definition of a specific document structure. For example, Core Vocabularies are based on DCTERMS, that provides an XML schema, so Core Person could import the DCTERMS XML schema for the usage of AgentType: In cases where the Core Vocabulary does not provide an XSD schema, it is necessary to create the XML element definitions in the new XSD schema corresponding to the reused URIs. Crucially, these new elements must adhere to the namespace defined by the Core Vocabulary to maintain consistency. For example “AgentType” must be defined within the “http://data.europa.eu/m8g/” namespace of the Core Vocabularies. Furthermore, when integrating these elements into a new schema, it is essential to reflect the constraints from the core vocabulary’s data shape—specifically, which properties are optional and which are mandatory–within the XSD schema element definitions. In designing XML schemas, the selection of a design pattern has implications for the reusability and extension of the schema. The Venetian Blind and Garden of Eden patterns stand out as preferable for their ability to allow complex types to be reused by different elements [sem-map]. The Venetian Blind pattern is characterised by having a single global element that serves as the entry point for the XML document, from which all the elements can be reached. This pattern implies a certain directionality and starting point, analogous to choosing a primary class in an ontology that has direct relationships to other classes, and from which one can navigate to the rest of the classes. Adopting Venetian Blind pattern reduces the variability in its application and deems the schema usable in specific scenarios by providing not only well-defined elements, but also a rigid and predictable structure. On the other hand, the Garden of Eden pattern allows for multiple global elements, providing various entry points into the XML document. This pattern accommodates ontologies where no single class is inherently central, mirroring the flexibility of graph representations in ontologies that do not have a strict hierarchical starting point. Adopting the Garden of Eden pattern provides a less constrained approach, enabling users to represent information starting from different elements that may hold significance in different contexts. This approach has been adopted by standardisation initiatives such as NIEM and UBL, which recommend such flexibility for broader applicability and ease of information representation. However, the Garden of Eden pattern does not lead to a schema that can be used in final application scenarios, because it does not ensure a single stable document structure but leaves the possibility for variations. This schema pattern requires an additional composition specification. For example, if it is used in a SOAP API, the developers can decide on using multiple starting points to facilitate exchange of granular messages specific per API endpoint. This way the XSD schema remains reusable for different API endpoints and even API implementations. Overall, the choice between these patterns should be informed by the intended use of the schema, the level of abstraction of the ontology it represents, and the needs of the end-users, aiming to strike a balance between structure and flexibility. Recommendation: We consider the Garden of Eden pattern suitable for designing XSD schemas at the level of core or domain semantic data specifications, and the Venetian Blind pattern suitable for XSD schemas at the level of specific Application Profiles.+ Recommendation for choosing the appropriate pattern: The Venetian Blind Pattern suits Application Profiles where a central entity is the main entry point, offering a structured schema for defined use cases. The Garden of Eden Pattern is better for Core or Domain Data Specifications, where multiple entry points provide flexibility for general-purpose data models. Complex types should be defined, if deemed necessary, only after importing or defining the basic elements and application of patterns. Complex types are deemed complex when they have multiple properties, be they attributes or relationships. Finally, complete the XSD schema by adding annotations and documentation using the `xs:annotation’ and `xs:documentation’ tags. This improves understanding of the schema’s content both for external users and oneself at a later date, as well as communicating the purpose so that the schema will be deployed as intended. The schema should be validated with at least one sample XML document, both to verify that it is syntactically correct and semantically as intended and has adequate coverage. SEMIC XSD schemas need to adhere to best practices and validation rules to maintain consistency, clarity, and reusability across schemas. These rules include naming conventions, documentation standards, and structural rules.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"guideline-create-xsd-for-cv","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/guideline-create-xsd-for-cv.html","titles":[{"text":"Guideline to Create a new XSD Schema","hash":"sec:create-a-new-xsd-schema","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1: Import or define elements","hash":"_phase_1_import_or_define_elements","id":2},{"text":"Phase 2: Shape XML document structure","hash":"_phase_2_shape_xml_document_structure","id":3},{"text":"Phase 3: Validation","hash":"_phase_3_validation","id":4}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC2.2. In order to create an XSD mapping one needs to decide on the purpose and level of specificity of the XSD schema mapping. It can range from producing a lightweight alignment at the level of vocabulary down to a fully fledged executable set of rules for data transformation. In this section we describe a methodology that covers both the conceptual mapping and the technical mapping for data transformation, and wrapping it up with validation and documentation. Figure 1 depicts a workflow to create an XSD schema mapping, which is segmented into five phases: Understand the XSD Schema and prepare test data, to ensure any preparations are completed before the mapping process; Create a Conceptual Mapping, so that business and domain experts can validate the correspondences It involves defining the correspondence between the XML elements from the XSD schema and the terms in the vocabulary; Create a Technical Mapping, so that the data can be automatically transformed. It involves converting the conceptual mappings into machine-executable transformation rules, focussing on the actual transformation of XML to RDF; Validate the mapping rules to ensure consistency and accuracy; Disseminate the documentation including, mainly, the used and generated files, mapping rules, and validation reports, to be applied in the foreseen use cases of the transformation pipelines. Figure 1. Workflow to create an XSD schema mapping Before initiating the mapping development process, it is crucial to construct a representative test dataset. This dataset should consist of a carefully selected set of XML files that cover the important scenarios and use cases encountered in the production data. It should be comprehensive yet sufficiently compact to facilitate rapid transformation cycles, enabling effective testing iterations in the validation phase. Also, it must align with the XSD schema for which it is test data. Conceptual Mapping in semantic data integration, i.e., regarding what from the source needs to map to what in the target, can be established at two distinct levels: the vocabulary level and the application profile level. These levels differ primarily in their complexity and specificity regarding the data context they address. We need to declare two mappings: regarding the vocabulary and the application profile. A Vocabulary mapping mapping is established using basic XML elements. This form of mapping aims at a terminological alignment, meaning that an XML element or attribute is directly mapped to an ontology class or property. For example, an XML element could be mapped to locn:Address class in a Core Vocabulary, or an element could be mapped to a property foaf:familyName in the FOAF ontology. Such mappings can be established and written in a simple spreadsheet. This approach results in a basic 1:1 direct alignment, which lacks contextual depth and specificity. A more advanced approach would be to embed semantic annotations into XSD schemas using standards such as SAWSDL. Such an approach is appropriate in the context of WSDL services. The Application Profile mapping of the conceptual mapping utilises XPath to guide access to data in XML tree structures, enabling precise extraction and contextualization of data before mapping it to specific ontology fragments. An ontology fragment is usually expressed as a SPARQL Property Path (or simply: a Property Path). This Property Path facilitates the description of instantiation patterns specific to the Application Profile. This advanced approach allows for context-sensitive semantic representations, crucial for accurately reflecting the nuances in interpreting the meaning of data structures. The tables below show two examples of mapping the organisation’s address, city and postal code. They show where the data can be extracted from, and how it can be mapped to targeted ontology properties such as locn:postName, and locn:postCode in the vocabulary. To ensure that this address is not mapped in a vacuum, but it is linked to an organisation instance, and not a person for example, the mapping is anchored in an instance ?this of an owl:Organisation. Optionally, a class path can be provided to complement the property path and explicitly state the class sequence, which otherwise can be deduced from the Application Profile definition. Source XPath */efac:Company/cac:PostalAddress/cbc:PostalZone Target Property Path ?this cv:registeredAddress / locn:postCode ?value . Target Class Path org:Organization / locn:Address / rdf:PlainLiteral Source XPath */efac:Company/cac:PostalAddress/cbc:CityName Target Property Path ?this cv:registeredAddress / locn:postName ?value . Target Class Path org:Organization / locn:Address / rdf:PlainLiteral Inputs: XSD Schemas, Ontologies, SHACL Data Shapes, Source and Target Documentation, Sample XML data Outputs: Conceptual Mapping Spreadsheet The technical mapping step is a critical phase in the mapping process, serving as the bridge between conceptual design and practical, machine-executable implementation. This step takes as input the conceptual mapping, which has been crafted and validated by domain experts or data-savvy business stakeholders and establishes correspondences between XPath expressions and ontology fragments. When it comes to representing these mappings technically, several technology options are available (paper): such as XSLT, RML, SPARQLAnything, etc. But RDF Mapping Language (RML) stands out for its effectiveness and straightforward approach. RML allows for the representation of mappings from heterogeneous data formats like XML, JSON, relational databases and CSV into RDF, supporting the creation of semantically enriched data models. This code can be expressed in Turtle RML or the YARRRML dialect, a user-friendly text-based format based on YAML, making the mappings accessible to both machines and humans. RML is well-supported by robust implementations such as RMLMapper and RMLStreamer, which provide robust platforms for executing these mappings. RMLMapper is adept at handling batch processing of data, transforming large datasets efficiently. RMLStreamer excels in streaming data scenarios, where data needs to be processed in real-time, providing flexibility and scalability in dynamic environments. The development of the mapping rules is straightforward due to the conceptual mapping that is already available from Phase 2. Then, RML mapping statements are created for each class of the target ontology coupled with the property-object mapping statements specific to that class. Furthermore, it is essential to master RML along with XML technologies such as XSD, XPath, and XQuery to implement the mappings effectively (rml-gen). An additional step involves deciding on a URI creation policy and designing a uniform scheme for use in the generated data, ensuring consistency and coherence in the data output. A viable alternative to RML is XSLT technology, which offers a powerful, but low-level method for defining technical mappings. While this method allows for high expressiveness and complex transformations, it also increases the potential for errors due to its intricate syntax and operational complexity. This technology excels in scenarios requiring detailed manipulation and parameterization of XML documents, surpassing the capabilities of RML in terms of flexibility and depth of transformation rules that can be implemented. However, the detailed control it affords means that developers must have a high level of expertise in semantic technologies and exercise caution and precision to avoid common pitfalls associated with its use. A pertinent example of XSLT’s application is the tool for transforming ISO-19139 metadata to the DCAT-AP geospatial profile (GeoDCAT-AP) in the framework of INSPIRE and the EU ISA Programme. This XSLT script is configurable to accommodate transformation with various operational parameters such as the selection between core or extended GeoDCAT-AP profiles and specific spatial reference systems for geometry encoding, showcasing its utility in precise and tailored data manipulation tasks. Inputs: Conceptual Mapping spreadsheet, sample XML data Outputs: Technical Mapping source code, sample data transformed into RDF Given the output of Phase 3 and the test data preparation from Phase 1, first transform the sample XML data into RDF, which will be used for validation testing. Two primary methods of validation are employed to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data transformation: SPARQL-based validation and SHACL-based validation. They offer two fundamental methodologies for ensuring data integrity and conformity within semantic technologies, each serving distinct but complementary functions. The SPARQL-based validation method utilises SPARQL ASK queries, which are derived from the SPARQL Property Path expressions (and complementary Class paths) created as part of the conceptual mapping phase. These expressions serve as assertions that test specific conditions or patterns within the RDF data corresponding to each conceptual mapping rule. By executing these queries, it is possible to confirm whether certain data elements and relationships have been correctly instantiated according to the mapping rules. The ASK queries return a boolean value indicating whether the RDF data meets the conditions specified in the query, thus providing a straightforward mechanism for validation. This confirms that the conceptual mapping is implemented correctly in a technical mapping rule. For example, for the mapping rules above, the following assertions can be derived: ASK { ?this a org:Organization . ?this cv:registeredAddress / locn:postName ?value . } ASK { ?this a org:Organization . ?this cv:registeredAddress / locn:postCode ?value . } The SHACL-based validation method provides a more comprehensive framework for validating RDF data. In this approach, data shapes are defined according to the constraints and structures expected in the RDF output, as specified by the mapped Application Profile. These shapes act as templates that the RDF data must conform to, covering various aspects such as data types, relationships, cardinality, and more. A SHACL validation engine processes the RDF data against these shapes, identifying any deviations or errors that indicate non-conformity with the expected data model. SHACL is an ideal choice for ensuring adherence to broad data standards and interoperability requirements. This form of validation is independent of the manner in which data mappings are constructed, focusing instead on whether the data conforms to established semantic models at the end-state. It provides a high-level assurance that data structures and content meet the specifications designed to facilitate seamless data integration and interactions across various systems. Conversely, SPARQL-based validation is tightly linked to the mapping process itself, offering a granular, rule-by-rule validation that ensures each data transformation aligns precisely with the expert-validated mappings. It is particularly effective in confirming the accuracy of complex mappings and ensuring that the implemented data transformations faithfully reflect the intended semantic interpretations, thus providing a comprehensive check on the fidelity of the mapping process. Inputs: Sample data transformed into RDF, Conceptual Mapping, Technical Mapping, SHACL data shapes Outputs: Validation reports Once the conceptual and technical mappings have been completed and validated, they can be packaged for dissemination and deployment. The purpose of disseminating mapping packages are to facilitate their controlled use for data transformation, to ensure the ability to trace the evolution of mapping rules, and to standardise the exchange of such rules. This structured approach allows for efficient and reliable data transformation processes across different systems. A comprehensive mapping package typically includes: Conceptual Mapping Files: Serves as the core documentation, outlining the rationale and structure behind the mappings to ensure transparency and ease of understanding for both domain experts and engineers. Technical Mapping Files: This contains all the mapping code files ( XSLT, RML, SPARQLAnything etc., depending on the chosen mapping technology) for data transformation, allowing for the practical application of the conceptual designs. Additional Mapping Resources: Such as controlled lists, value mappings, or correspondence tables, which are crucial for the correct interpretation and application of the RML code. These should be stored in a dedicated resources subfolder. Test Data Sets: Carefully selected and representative XML files that cover various scenarios and cases. These test datasets are crucial for ensuring that the mappings perform as expected across a range of real-world data. Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) Reports: They document the testing outcomes based on the SPARQL and SHACL validations to guarantee that the mappings meet the expected standards before deployment. The generation of these reports should be supported by automation, as manual generation would involve too much effort and costs. Tests Used for FAT Reports: The package also incorporates the actual SPARQL assertions and SHACL shapes used in generating the FAT reports, providing a complete view of the validation process. Descriptive Metadata: Contains essential data about the mapping package, such as identification, title, description, and versions of the mapping, ontology, and source schemas. This metadata aids in the management and application of the package. This package is designed to be self-contained, ensuring that it can be immediately integrated and operational within various data transformation pipelines. The included components support not only the application, but also the governance of the mappings, ensuring they are maintained and utilised correctly in diverse IT environments. This systematic packaging addresses critical needs for usability, maintainability, and standardisation, which are essential for widespread adoption and operational success in data transformation initiatives.

Core Vocabularies Handbook 1.1. SEMIC Core Vocabularies 1.2. Conceptual framework 1.3. Use cases 1.4. How to create new data models 1.5. Glossary This Handbook aims to explain the role of Core Vocabularies in enabling semantic interoperability at the EU level and to practically guide public administrations in using Core Vocabularies to achieve this goal. This section introduces what interoperability is, what makes it semantic, and how Core Vocabularies contribute to it. This section contains a brief overview of the Core Vocabularies, indicating how they were developed and how they are maintained. Since 2011, the European Commission facilitates international working groups to forge consensus and maintain the SEMIC Core Vocabularies. A short description of these vocabularies is included in the Table below. The latest release of the Core Vocabularies can be retrieved via the SEMIC Support Center [semic] or directly from the GitHub repository [semic-gh]. Vocabulary Description The Core Person Vocabulary (CPV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a person; e.g., the name, gender, date of birth, and location. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing person-related information. The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity; e.g., the legal name, activity, and address. The Core Business Vocabulary includes a minimal number of classes and properties modelled to capture the typical details recorded by business registers. It facilitates information exchange between business registers despite differences in what they record and publish. The Core Location Vocabulary (CLV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. The Location Core Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a location represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. This specification enables interoperability among land registers and any other ICT based solution exchanging and processing location information. The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) supports the exchange of information between organisations that define criteria and organisations that respond to these criteria by means of evidence. The Core Evidence and Core Criterion Vocabulary (CCCEV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate development of interoperable information systems: the use of common vocabularies to describe criteria and evidence facilitates the development of information systems and improves their interoperability. Create a repository of reusable criteria in machine-readable formats: the use of common vocabularies promotes the creation of a repository of criteria and evidence information. Automate the assessment of criteria: the Core Vocabulary describing the criterion responses allows systems to easily compare the information collected from different parties and enables automatic assessment of the responses for a specific criterion. Automate scoring of responses: weighting criteria, the assessment can be followed by an automated scoring of the responses provided by different parties. Promote cross-border participation in public procurement: the use of the Core Vocabulary for electronic criterion and evidence allows for removing language barriers thereby improving the cross border exchange of information, and the cross-border participation in pan-European selection processes. Calculating statistics: standardising data for criterion, criterion responses and evidence allows calculating statistical information on the most commonly used criteria for a given process, the most relevant evidence, etc. Create a registry of mappings of criteria: using the Core Vocabulary, it is possible to create a registry of mappings to allow cross-checking of the criteria with the evidence of each particular Member State. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary provides a common data model for describing public organisations in the European Union. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary (CPOV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate information sharing: the CPOV enables G2G (Government-to-Government), G2B (Government-to-Business) and G2C (Government-to-Citizen) information sharing. Facilitate the development of common information systems: the use of existing data models for the development of common information systems facilitates the development of those systems and improves their interoperability. Linked Open Organograms: the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary has the potential to link organograms to each other and to high-value data sets. Cross border information exchange: the CPOV allows the management of a cross-border repository of public services and organisations. Find a PO by its function: the public organisation portfolio facilitates discovery of which public authorities and departments are responsible for given areas of the public task. Increase efficiency: the CPOV helps to identify where responsibilities and functions are duplicated or overlap. The Core Public Event Vocabulary (CPEV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a public event, e.g. the title, the date, the location, the organiser etc. The Core Public Event Vocabulary aspires to become a common data model for describing public events (conferences, summits, etc.) in the European Union. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing information related to public events. The Core Vocabularies are semantic data specifications that are disseminated as the following artefacts: lightweight ontology [sem-sg-wio] for vocabulary definition expressed in OWL [owl2]; loose data shape specification [sem-sg-wds] expressed in SHACL [shacl]; human-readable reference documentation [sem-sg-wdsd] in HTML (based on ReSpec [respec]); JSON-LD [w3c] context definitions [json-ld]; conceptual model specification [sem-sg-wcm] expressed in UML [uml]. The Core Vocabularies are published under the CC-BY 4.0 licence [cc-by]. The Core Vocabularies have been developed following the ‘Process and methodology for developing Core Vocabularies’ [cv-met], which has an open change and release management process , supported by SEMIC, that ensures continuous improvement and relevance to evolving user needs. This process begins with the identification of needs from stakeholders or issues raised in existing implementations. The Working Group members, SEMIC team or community of users propose changes that are thoroughly assessed for their impact and feasibility. Once a change is deemed necessary, it undergoes a drafting phase where the technical details are fleshed out, followed by public consultations to gather wider input and ensure transparency. Following consultations, the changes are refined and prepared for implementation. This stage may involve further iteration based on feedback or additional insights from ongoing discussions. The finalised changes are then formally approved and documented, ensuring they are well-understood and agreed upon by all relevant parties. The release management of Core Vocabularies follows a structured timeline that includes pre-announced releases and public consultation periods to allow users to prepare for changes. Each release includes detailed documentation to support implementation, ensuring users can integrate new versions with minimal disruption. This process not only maintains the quality and relevance of the Core Vocabularies, but also supports a dynamic and responsive framework for semantic interoperability within digital public services. Claiming conformance to Core Vocabularies is an integral part of validating (a) how well a new or a mapped data model or semantic data specification aligns with the principles and practices established in the SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] and (b) to what degree the Core Vocabularies are reused (fully or partially) [sem-sg-reuse]. The conformance assessment is voluntary, and shall be published as a self-conformance statement. This statement must assert which requirements are met by the data model or semantic specification. The conformance statement highlights various levels of adherence, ranging from basic implementation to more complex semantic representations. At the basic level, conformance might simply involve ensuring that data usage is consistent with the terms (and structure, but no formal semantics) defined by the Core Vocabularies. Moving to a more advanced level of conformance, data may be easily transformed into formats like RDF or JSON-LD, which are conducive to richer semantic processing and integration. This level of conformance signifies a deeper integration of the Core Vocabularies, facilitating a more robust semantic interoperability across systems. Ultimately, the highest level of conformance is achieved when the data is represented in RDF and fully leverages the semantic capabilities of the Core Vocabularies. This includes using a range of semantic technologies, adhering to the SEMIC Style Guide, fully reusing the Core Vocabularies, and respecting the associated data shapes. This section delves into the conceptual framework of semantic data specifications. Understanding this framework allows stakeholders to use the semantic data specifications effectively and align expectations and practices ensuring consistent and effective communication. The structure of the section is methodically organised into several subsections, each focusing on a different element of semantic data specifications. It begins with a broad overview of the specifications, and establishes what the artefacts are. Then progressively it narrows down to specific artefacts types, namely data models and documentation. Further subsections explore data models interaction across different layers of data interoperability, and semantic data specification types. This sequential approach helps readers build a comprehensive understanding from general concepts to specific explanations. Semantic data specifications are composite standards designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability among diverse systems, characterised by their descriptive and prescriptive nature. These specifications are realised through a suite of artefacts that are harmoniously interrelated and address different interoperability scopes and use cases—ranging from semantic to technical concerns. The artefacts are fashioned to be both machine-readable and human-understandable, ensuring consistent interpretation and utilisation. Figure 1 depicts a conceptualisation of how various components that make up a complete semantic data specification interconnect. At the top of the diagram is the \"Semantic data specification\" indicating its overarching role. It serves a \"Purpose/Goal\" which frames various specific \"Concern/Need\". The semantic data specification comprises various \"Artefacts\" denoting the different elements that make up the specification. Figure 1 Beneath this, the framework branches into two main types of artefacts: \"Data models” and \"Documentation\". The most relevant data models are \"Vocabulary\", \"Ontology\", \"Data shape\" and \"UML Class model\". Each data model is expressed in a \"Modelling language\" appropriate for the concern or the need addressed. The next section introduces the relevant artefact types. Integral to semantic data specifications is the intrinsic consistency and coherence among the artefacts. Each represents a facet of the same domain knowledge, but is tailored to address specific concerns—such as human understandability, semantic underpinning, formal definition, and data serialisation (addressed in the next section). This alignment ensures that each artefact, while distinct in function, contributes to a unified view of the domain, making the entire specification accessible and actionable. Such consistency is pivotal in maintaining semantic integrity, leading to robust technical interoperability and seamless information exchange. Each artefact, while unique in its form and function, represents different facets of the same domain. They are harmonised, yet distinct, with each created to address specific concerns, such as: Semantic Underpinning: The semantic data specification needs to encapsulate formally the domain knowledge, capturing the essence of its concepts and the possible relationships between them. Ontologies play a key role here, offering a structured and logical framework that lays out the domain knowledge in a way that is both comprehensive and actionable. Formal Definition: Using formal languages such as OWL or RDFS for semantic representation enables precise interpretation and inference over the ontologies and instance data. Moreover, data shapes facilitate data structuring on top of the ontology, defining precise constraints and conditions under which the data can be instantiated. This formalisation ensures that the data adheres to the standard, facilitating automated validation and processing. Human Understandability: This aspect ensures that individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, can comprehend and engage with the semantic data specifications. The reference documentation along with visual representation of UML class diagrams brings clarity and guidance for human users to grasp the meaning of the semantic data specification and its intended use. Visual Representation: The semantic data specification is much easier to understand once it is presented in a visual format. Typically class diagrams are the most suitable to encapsulate the concepts and the relations between boosting significantly comprehension. Data Serialisation: The technical artefacts of the specification, such as information exchange data models for various serialisation formats (e.g., JSON-LD, XML), ensure that the data can be correctly serialised, deserialized, and exchanged across systems and platforms. They cater for the technical requirements of data transport (and storage). The coherence among these artefacts ensures that despite their different purposes and audiences, they all align in their representation of the domain knowledge. This alignment guarantees that whether a stakeholder is interpreting the model conceptually, engaging with it through documentation, or implementing it technically, they are presented with a unified and consistent view of the semantic data specification. This cohesive approach is pivotal for maintaining semantic integrity across various applications and systems. The key data model artefacts of a specification include: Vocabulary: An established list of preferred terms that signify concepts or relationships within a domain of discourse. All terms must have an unambiguous and non-redundant definition. Optionally it may include synonyms, notes and their translation to multiple languages. It is represented informally, for example, as a spreadsheet or SKOS thesaurus. Ontology: An ontology is a formal, machine-readable specification of a conceptual model [Harpring2016]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming using URIs, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse, effectively enabling a shared and common understanding of data [wiki-onto]. It is usually expressed in OWL and RDFS. Data Shape: Constraints or patterns that describe how instantiations of an ontology should be structured. Data shape artefacts can be used not only to ensure that RDF data adheres to predefined structure and validation rules, but also as a blueprint for information exchange data models, preserving semantics and ensuring consistency in data exchange. It is usually expressed in SHACL. Controlled list (of values): A value vocabulary used to express concepts or values in instance data. It defines resources (such as instances of topics, languages, countries, or authors) that are used as values for elements in metadata records. Typically, the value vocabularies serve as reference data and constitute \"building blocks\" with which metadata records can be populated. UML class model: A static structure UML model and associated diagrams that describes the structure of data by showing the classes, their attributes, and the relationships among objects. It may include documentation, description and various annotations. Such data model shall be conformant to the SEMIC style guide in order to fit for purpose of semantic data specifications. Human-readable documentation: This artefact elucidates the specifications for stakeholders of varying business and technical backgrounds, detailing the structure, intent, and practical application of the semantic data specification. Beyond these foundational elements, semantic data specifications may also incorporate artefacts designed for the technical interoperability layer called information exchange data models. They define and describe in a technology-specific manner the structure and content of information that is exchanged between organisations in a specific information exchange context. They detail the syntax, structure, data types, and constraints necessary for effective data communication between systems. These artefacts are necessary to realise the technical interoperability. If the chosen technology for exchange is of semantic nature (e.g. RDF), then a perfect syntax-semantics conflation is readily available through ontologies and data shapes. Otherwise, if a more traditional technology is selected due to popularity or legacy reasons, such as XML/XSD or JSON, then a mapping that acts as a syntax-semantics interface needs to be established, binding the physical model and the semantic specification. These can include various information exchange data models like: JSON-LD context definitions: Facilitating the mapping of JSON to RDF linked data representation. XML Schemas (XSD): Defining the structure and validating the constraints of XML documents. API (Component) Specifications (REST, WSDL or GraphQL): Outlining the request, response and parameters for web-based data access and manipulation [swagger]. Such components are generally reusable blocks to facilitate reusability and maintenance of APIs. In the framework depicted [below], the artefacts are strategically organised within the semantic and technical interoperability layers, with each layer focusing on different but complementary aspects of data interoperability. As it can be seen, some artefacts belong to the semantic layer, and others to the technical layer, while the data shapes are present in both, according to their multipurpose nature. The Semantic Layer encapsulates artefacts associated with the conceptual understanding of data. It is focused on defining the vocabulary and ontology that provide the foundational elements for data interoperability. These artefacts ensure that the meaning of data is clearly defined and shared across different systems, establishing the semantic rules that govern data exchange. The Technical Layer is concerned with the practical aspects of data handling, such as data representation formats, communication protocols, and interface specifications. Artefacts in this layer address the technical requirements necessary for data to be physically exchanged and processed by information systems. Documentation and UML Class models are depicted as orthogonal to these layers, as they facilitate human understanding and transcend the semantic-technical divide. These artefacts provide clarity and guidance, helping stakeholders visualise and comprehend the data structures and relationships without being confined to the constraints of either layer. We can discern three interconnected layers each representing a different level of abstraction in semantic data specifications. The arrangement signifies the gradation from the abstract to the specific. The Upper Layer accommodates the most abstract form of semantic data specifications. These specifications are context-free, meaning that they are not tied to any particular domain or application, and can be universally applied across various fields. These semantic data specifications, provide the broadest concepts that can be reused in numerous contexts. Here we generally find upper level ontologies (defining highly abstract foundational concepts such as “object”, “property”, “event” etc.), but also the core semantic data specifications, which, although more specific, can also be applied across multiple domains. The main objective of the Core Vocabularies is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context [sem-sg-wsds]. Upper ontologies and core semantic data specifications serve as a scaffolding for domain ontologies, offering a hierarchy where the more general terms of the upper ontology act as superclasses (in some cases even as metaclasses) to the more specific classes of domain ontologies. This arrangement supports the structuring and integration of knowledge by providing common reference points that enhance understanding and data processing across different systems. Notable examples: Upper ontologies: DOLCE, Gist, BFO, etc. Core Vocabularies: Dublin Core Terms, Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), The Organization Ontology (ORG), European Legislation Identifier (ELI) The Domain Layer sits at the intersection of the upper and application layers. It contains specifications that are more specific than the upper layer, but not as narrowly focused as the application layer. The semantic data specifications in this layer incorporate concepts relevant to a domain or sector (e.g. the justice domain, the public procurement domain, the healthcare domain) and represent the most specific knowledge from the perspective of that domain. The domain layer is visually overlapped by both the upper and application layers, symbolising that some domain-specific semantic data specifications can inherit traits from, or lend characteristics to, both the more abstract upper layer and the more concrete application layer. Notable examples: DCAT-AP eProcurement Ontology The Application Layer is the most concrete and context-specific, containing semantic data specifications tailored for particular applications or families of applications. Application Profiles are detailed in constraints and data shapes, addressing explicit needs and constraints of a specific system or use case, and generally provide precise technical artefacts that can be used in data exchange. Notable examples: GeoDCAT-AP BRegDCAT-AP Stat-DCAT-AP Terminological Clarification: The level of abstraction pertaining to a semantic data specification—be it core, domain, or application—can be applied as an adjective to describe its constituent artefacts. Thus, for a \"core semantic data specification\" the included components would be referred to as \"core vocabulary\", \"core ontology\", \"core data shape\" and \"core exchange data model\" and so on. Similarly, for a \"domain semantic data specification,\" the elements would be denoted as \"domain vocabulary\", \"domain ontology\", \"domain data shape\" and \"domain exchange data model\", respectively. In the semantic data specification framework depicted [below], the documentation artefacts are organised into three distinct types, as illustrated in Figure 2, each catering to different aspects of user engagement with the data model. For effective documentation practices, we recommend principles laid out in the Diátaxis framework, which is a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users [dtx]. It identifies four distinct needs (learning, understanding, consulting reference, achieving goals), and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, handbooks, reference documentation and textbooks. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs. In addition, we mention the Diagrams, which are usually embedded into documents, to underline the importance of visual depiction of models and to recognise them as distinct artefacts from the models (e.g. UML class diagrams). In the context of semantic data specifications we find relevant the following documentation kinds. Figure 2 The Handbook (or usage manual) is a how-to guide and serves as an introductory reading to users new to the semantic data specification. It can also take the form of a tutorial to achieve predefined goals. It typically comprises use-case descriptions, examples and practical, step-by-step instructions designed to help users acquire the necessary skills to effectively use the semantic data specification. Examples: This document The Textbook (or explanatory manual) is an explanatory type of documentation and focuses on deepening the users’ understanding of the underlying concepts and principles incorporated into the semantic data specification. It aims to inform cognition, enhancing the user’s theoretical knowledge and conceptual insight, which is critical for those looking to gain a more profound grasp of the specification’s rationale, decisions, strengths and limitations. Examples: SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] The Reference document is a technical type of documentation and provides concise, detailed information about various elements of the semantic data specification. It serves users who are already familiar with the theoretical framework and need to apply their knowledge to specific tasks. This artefact is a go-to resource for factual and objective data about the semantic specifications, such as semantics, syntax, entities, properties, relationships, and constraints within the data model. Examples: reference documents for Core Person [cpv], Core Business [cbv], etc. These documentation artefacts are designed to collectively support the user’s journey from novice to expert within the semantic data specification domain. The Usage Manual aids in initial skill acquisition, the Explanatory Textbook supports deeper learning and understanding, and the Reference Documentation acts as a reliable resource for informed application and use. Together, they ensure that users at different stages of learning and practice have access to the appropriate materials to meet their needs. This handbook serves as a practical guide for using Core Vocabularies in various common situations. To provide clear and actionable insights, we have categorized potential use cases into two groups: Primary Use Cases: These are the most common, interesting, and/or challenging scenarios, all thoroughly covered within this handbook. Additional Use Cases: These briefly introduce other relevant scenarios but are not elaborated on in detail in this handbook. Within both groups, we differentiate between use cases focused on the creation of NEW artefacts and those involving the mapping of EXISTING artefacts to Core Vocabularies. For a better overview, we numbered the use cases and organised them into two diagrams, followed by the description of these use cases in two separate subsections, one dedicated to the addressed use cases and one to the use cases that are not addressed in this handbook. The use cases provided in this handbook are written in white-box point of style oriented towards user goals following the classification of [Cockburn99]. We will use the following template to describe the relevant use cases: Use Case : Title of the use case Goal: A succinct sentence describing the goal of the use case Primary Actor: The primary actor or actors of this use case Actors: (Optional) Other actors involved in the use case Description: Short description of the use case providing relevant information for its understanding Example: An example to illustrate the application of this use case Note: (Optional) notes about this use case, especially related to its coverage in this handbook Use Case UC1: Create a new information exchange data model Goal: Create a new standalone data schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. Note: As this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data formats. Use Case UC1.1: Create a new XSD schema Goal: Create a new standalone XSD schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new XSD schema that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, an XSD Schema can be used to create and validate XML data to be exchanged between information systems. Example: OOTS XML schema creation procedure [oots] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Create a new XSD schema Use Case UC1.2: Create a new JSON-LD context definition Goal: Create a new standalone JSON-LD context definition that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new JSON-LD context definition that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, a JSON-LD context definition can be integrated in describing data, building APIs, and other operations involved in information exchange. Example: Core Person Vocabulary [cpv-json-ld], Core Business Vocabulary [cbv-json-ld] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for use cases will be provided in the Create a new JSON-LD context definition section. Use Case UC2: Map an existing data model to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping of an existing (information exchange) data model, to terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a mapping of an ontology, vocabulary, or some kind of data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, to terms from CVs. Such a mapping can be done at a conceptual level, or formally, e.g. in the form of transformation rules, and most often will include both. Note: Since this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data models and/or data formats. Some of those use cases will be described in detail below, while others will be included in the Appendix, which is dedicated to the additional use cases. Use Case UC2.1: Map an existing Conceptual Model to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping between the terms of an existing ontology and the terms of Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping expressed in Semantic Web terminology (for example using rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, owl:sameAs properties), associating the terms in an existing ontology that defines relevant concepts in a given domain, to terms defined in one or more CVs. This activity is usually performed by a semantic engineer based on input received from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping associates the terms in an existing ontology, which defines relevant concepts within a specific domain, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. The result of the formal mapping can be used later by software engineers to build information exchange systems. Example: Mapping Core Person to Schema.org [map-cp2org], Core Business to Schema.org [map-cb2org], etc. Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing conceptual model section. Use Case UC2.2: Map an existing XSD Schema to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Define the data transformation rules for the mapping of an XSD schema to terms from Core Vocabularies. Create a mapping of XML data that conforms to an existing XSD schema to an RDF representation that conforms to a Core Vocabulary for formal data transformation. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. RML or other languages), to allow automated translation of XML data conforming to a certain XSD schema, to RDF data expressed in terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. This use case required definitions of an Application Profile for a Core Vocabulary because the CV alone does not specify sufficient instantiation constraints to be precisely mappable. Such activity can be done by semantic engineers based on input from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping is usually used as the basis for the formal mapping. The conceptual mapping can be a simple correspondence table associating the XML Elements defined in an XSD schema, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. In some cases the creation of the conceptual mapping can be done by the semantic engineers themselves, or even by the software engineers building information exchange systems. Example: ISA2core SAWSDL mapping [isa2-map] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing XSD schema section. The additional use cases are described in the Appendix. This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC1.1. To create a new XSD schema, the following steps need to be observed: Import or define elements Shape structure with patterns When working with XML schemas, particularly in relation to semantic artefacts like ontologies or data shapes, managing the imports and namespaces are vital considerations that ensure clarity, reusability, and proper integration of various data models. When a core vocabulary has defined an associated XSD schema, it is not only easy but also advisable to directly import this schema using the xsd:import statement. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the core vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. The imported elements are then employed in the definition of a specific document structure. For example, Core Vocabularies are based on DCTERMS [ref], that provides an XML schema, so Core Person could import the DCTERMS XML schema for the usage of AgentType: In cases where the Core Vocabulary does not provide an XSD schema, it is necessary to create for the reused URIs the corresponding XML element definitions in the new XSD schema. Crucially, these new elements must adhere to the namespace defined by the Core Vocabulary to maintain consistency. For example “AgentType” must be defined within the “http://data.europa.eu/m8g/” namespace of the Core Vocabularies. Furthermore, when integrating these elements into a new schema, it is essential to reflect the constraints from the core vocabulary’s data shape-specifically, which properties are optional and which are mandatory - within the XSD schema element definitions. In designing XML schemas, the selection of a design pattern has implications for the reusability and extension of the schema. The Venetian Blind and Garden of Eden patterns stand out as preferable for their ability to allow complex types to be reused by different elements [sem-map]. The Venetian Blind pattern is characterised by having a single global element that serves as the entry point for the XML document, from which all the elements can be reached. This pattern implies a certain directionality and starting point, analogous to choosing a primary class in an ontology that has direct relationships to other classes, and from which one can navigate to the rest of the classes. For instance, in the Core Business Vocabulary, if one were to select the \"Legal Entity\" class as the starting point, it would shape the XML schema in such a way that all other classes could be reached from this entry point, reflecting its central role within the ontology. A possible implementation with Venetian Blind with “Legal Entity” as the root element would be: Adopting Venetian Blind pattern reduces the variability in its application and deems the schema usable in specific scenarios by providing not only well-defined elements, but also a rigid and predictable structure. On the other hand, the Garden of Eden pattern allows for multiple global elements, providing various entry points into the XML document. This pattern accommodates ontologies where no single class is inherently central, mirroring the flexibility of graph representations in ontologies that do not have a strict hierarchical starting point. Adopting the Garden of Eden pattern provides a less constrained approach, enabling users to represent information starting from different elements that may hold significance in different contexts. This approach has been adopted by standardisation initiatives such as NIEM and UBL, which recommend such flexibility for broader applicability and ease of information representation. However, the Garden of Eden pattern does not lead to a schema that can be used in final application scenarios, because it does not ensure a single stable document structure but leaves the possibility for variations. This schema pattern requires an additional composition specification. For example, if it is used in a SOAP API, the developers can decide on using multiple starting points to facilitate exchange of granular messages specific per API endpoint. This way the XSD schema remains reusable for different API endpoints and even API implementations. Overall, the choice between these patterns should be informed by the intended use of the schema, the level of abstraction of the ontology it represents, and the needs of the end-users, aiming to strike a balance between structure and flexibility. Recommendation: We consider the Garden of Eden pattern suitable for designing XSD schemas at the level of core or domain semantic data specifications, and the Venetian Blind pattern suitable for XSD schemas at the level of specific Application Profiles. This section provides detailed instructions for addressing use case UC1.2. JSON-LD combines the simplicity, power, and web ubiquity of JSON with the concepts of Linked Data. Creating JSON-LD context definitions facilitates this synergy. This ensures that when data is shared or integrated across systems, it maintains its meaning and can be understood in the same way across different contexts. Here’s a guide on how to create new JSON-LD contexts for existing CVs, using the Core Person Vocabulary as an example. Import or define elements Shape structure When a CV has defined an associated JSON-LD context, it is not only easy, but also advisable to directly import this context using the @import keyword. This enables seamless reuse and guarantees that any complex types or elements defined within the vocabulary are integrated correctly and transparently within new schemas. \"@context\": {\"@import\": \"https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld\", } In cases where the CV does not provide an JSON-LD context, it is necessary to create for the reused URIs the corresponding field element definitions. To start, gather all the terms from the Core Person Vocabulary that you want to include in your JSON-LD context. Terms can include properties like given name, family name, date of birth, and relationships like residency or contact point. Then, decide the desired structure of the JSON-LD file, by defining the corresponding keys, for example Person.givenName, Person.familyName, Person.dateOfBirth, Person.residency, Person.contactPoint. These new fields must adhere to the naming defined by the CV to maintain consistency. Finally, assign URIs to keys. Each term in your JSON-LD context must be associated with a URI from an ontology that defines its meaning in a globally unambiguous way. Associate the URIs established in CVs to JSON keys using the same CV terms. For example: \"Person.contactPoint\": {\"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\"}. The ones that are imported by the CVs, shall be used as originally defined, for example from FOAF: \"Person.givenName\": {\"@id\": \"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName\"}. Start defining the structure of the context by relating class terms with property terms and then, if necessary, property terms with other classes. Commence by creating a JSON structure that starts with a @context field. This field will contain mappings from your vocabulary terms to their respective URIs. Continue by defining fields for Classes and subfields for their properties. If the JSON-LD context is developed with the aim of being used directly in exchange specific to an application scenario, then aim to establish a complete tree structure that starts with a single root class. To do so, specify precise @type references linking to the specific Class. For example: \"Person.contactPoint\" : {\"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"ContactPoint\"}. If the aim of the developed JSON-LD context is rather ensuring semantic correspondences, without any structural constraints, which is the case for core or domain semantic data specification, then definitions of structures specific to each entity type and its properties suffice, using only loose references to other objects. For example: \"Person.contactPoint\": {\"@id\": \"http://data.europa.eu/m8g/contactPoint\", \"@type\": \"@id\"} Unresolved include directive in modules/ROOT/pages/handbook-as-a-whole.adoc - include::how-to-map-existing-data-models.adoc[] Alternative names: AP, context-specific semantic data specification Definition: Semantic data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context. Additional information: It re-uses concepts from one or more semantic data specifications, while adding more specificity, by identifying mandatory, recommended, and optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and providing recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Alternative names: conceptual model specification Definition: An abstract representation of a system that comprises well-defined concepts, their qualities or attributes, and their relationships to other concepts. Additional information: A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Alternative names: restriction, axiom, shape Definition: Restriction to which an entity or relation must adhere. Additional information: Models normally consist not only of the entity types and relationships between them, but also contain constraints that hold over them. The types of constraints that can be declared depend on the type of model. For instance, a SQL schema for a relational database has, among others, a data type constraint for each column specification and referential integrity constraints, a UML Class diagram has multiplicity constraints declared on an association to specify the amount of relations each instance is permitted to have, and an ontology may contain an axiom that declares an object property to be, e.g., symmetric or transitive. The list of permissible constraints typically is part of the modelling language, but it also may be an associated additional constraint language, such as SHACL for RDF and OCL for UML. Alternative names: CV Definition: A basic, reusable and extensible semantic data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Additional information: Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Definition: A structured representation of data elements and relationships used to facilitate semantic interoperability within and across domains. Additional information: Data models are represented in common languages to facilitate semantic interoperability in a data space, including ontologies, data models, schema specifications, mappings and API specifications that can be used to annotate and describe data sets and data services. They are often domain-specific. Source/Reference: Data Spaces Blueprint Alternative names: data schema Definition: Information exchange data model is a technology-specific framework for data exchange, detailing the syntax, structure, data types, and constraints necessary for effective data communication between systems. It serves as a practical blueprint for implementing an application profile in specific data exchange contexts. Additional information: An ontology and an exchange data model serve distinct yet complementary roles across different abstraction levels within data management systems. While a Data Schema specifies the technical structure for storing and exchanging data, primarily concerned with the syntactical and structural aspects of data, it is typically articulated using metamodel standards such as JSON Schema and XML Schema. In contrast, ontologies and data shapes operate at a higher conceptual level, outlining the knowledge and relational dynamics within a particular domain without delving into the specifics of data storage or structural implementations. Although a Data Schema can embody certain elements of an ontology or application profile—particularly attributes related to data structure and cardinalities necessary for data exchange—it does not encapsulate the complete semantics of the domain as expressed in an ontology. Thus, while exchange data models are essential for the technical realisation of data storage and exchange, they do not replace the broader, semantic understanding provided by ontologies. The interplay between these layers ensures that data schemas contribute to a holistic data management strategy by providing the necessary structure and constraints for data exchange, while ontologies offer the overarching semantic framework that guides the meaningful interpretation and utilisation of data across systems. Together, they facilitate a structured yet semantically rich data ecosystem conducive to advanced data interoperability and effective communication. Source/Reference: Data Spaces Blueprint Alternative names: specification artefact, artefact Definition: A materialisation of a semantic data specification in a concrete representation that is appropriate for addressing one or more concerns (e.g. use cases, requirements). Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Alternative names: specification document Definition: The human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape, or a combination of both. Additional information: A semantic data specification document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to understand (a) how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain, and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose. It is to serve as technical documentation for anyone interested in using (e.g. adopting or extending) a semantic data specification. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Alternative names: data shape constraint specification, data shape constraint, data shape Definition: A set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated. Additional information: The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Additional information: Generic term for any of the entries in this glossary, without the need for the existence of data and they may also serve purposes other than facilitating interoperability. SEMIC’s usage of models refers to structured information or knowledge that is represented in a suitable representation language, rather than to individual objects or the notion of ‘model’ in model-theoretic semantics of a logic. Definition: A formal specification describing the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents (e.g. domain experts) Additional information: It encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Alternative names: data specification Definition: An union of machine- and human-readable artefacts addressing clearly defined concerns, interoperability scope and use-cases. Additional information: A semantic data specification comprises at least an ontology and a data shape (or either of them individually) accompanied by a human-readable data specification document. Source/Reference: SEMIC Style Guide Definition: An established list of preferred terms that signify concepts or relationships within a domain of discourse. All terms must have an unambiguous and non-redundant definition. Optionally it may include synonyms, notes and their translation to multiple languages. Alternative names: top-level ontology, foundational ontology Definition: An upper ontology is a highly generalised ontology that includes entities considered useful across all subject domains, such as “endurant”, “independent continuant”, “process”, and “participates in”. Additional information: Its primary role is to facilitate broad semantic interoperability among numerous domain ontologies by offering a standardised foundational/top level hierarchy and relations together with its underlying philosophical commitments. This framework assists in harmonising diverse domain ontologies, allowing for consistent data interpretation and efficient information exchange.","title":"The SEMIC Style Guide for Semantic Engineers","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"handbook-as-a-whole","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/handbook-as-a-whole.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In this section we adopt the definitions from the ontology matching handbook EuzenatShvaiko13 for the following concepts: Ontology matching process: given a pair of ontologies, an input alignment, a set of parameters and a set of oracles and resources, the process returns an alignment between these ontologies Correspondence: given a pair of ontologies, a set of alignment relations (typically equivalence and subsumption) and a confidence structure for those alignments, then a correspondence is a 5-tuple consisting of an identifier of the correspondence, the two entities (one from each ontology), how the two entities relate, and a measure of the confidence in that alignment. Alignment: a set of correspondences between pairs of entities belonging to two ontologies. Mapping: a set of correspondences between pairs of entities belonging to two ontologies, and this mapping is satisfiable and does not lead to unsatisfiable entities in either of the two ontologies that are being matched. To create an ontology mapping, the following steps need to be observed: Staging: defining the requirements Characterisation: defining source and target data and performing data analysis Reuse: discover, evaluate, and reuse existing alignments Matching: execute and evaluate matching Align and map: prepare, create the alignment, and render mappings Validate: check whether the candidate alignments found are meaningful Application: publish the mappings and establish governance of the mappings This section provides an overview of the guideline, which will be demonstrated in the tutorial section where we map the Core Business Vocabulary to Schema.org. This initial phase involves a comprehensive understanding of the project’s scope, identifying the specific goals of the mapping exercise, and the key requirements it must fulfil. Stakeholders collaborate to articulate the purpose of the alignment between the models, setting clear objectives that will guide the process. Defining these requirements upfront ensures that subsequent steps are aligned with the model matching process’ overarching goals, stakeholder expectations, and fitting the use cases. Inputs: Stakeholder knowledge, project goals, available resources, domain expertise. Outputs: Mapping project specification document comprising a defined mapping project scope and comprehensive list of requirements. In this stage, a thorough analysis of both source and target ontologies is conducted to ascertain their structures, vocabularies, and the semantics they encapsulate. This involves an in-depth examination of the conceptual frameworks, data representation languages, and any existing constraints within both models. Understanding the nuances of both the source and target is critical for identifying potential challenges and opportunities in the matching process, ensuring that the process will be feasible and meaningful. The following is an indicative, but not exhaustive, list of aspects to consider in this analysis about the the two artefacts: specifications documentation, representation language and representation formats, deprecation mechanism, inheritance policy (single inheritance only or multiple inheritance are also allowed), natural language(s) used, label specification, label conventions, definition specification, definition conventions, and version management and release cycles. These features can have consequences for the mapping task. For instance, the files being available in the same format, such as both in JSON-LD, simplifies declaring and implementing the mappings technically, whereas if they are in a different format, one will have to be converted into the other format, if it is possible to do so without loss of meaning. The natural language of the ontology or vocabulary refers to the rendering of the entities’ names or labels, which may be one language, multiple languages equally, one language mainly and others with partial coverage. If the source and target are in a different natural language, the task is not simply one of mapping entities, but also translating names, labels, and annotations of entities. An infrequently updated version can indicate either that it is a stable release or that it is not maintained, and the comparison thus depends on a broader setting that may be worthwhile to ascertain. Conversely, a frequently updated version is less stable, and it may even be the case that by the time a matching process is completed with one version, a new version has been released that might require an update to the mapping. Depending on the feature, one will have to inspect either the computer-processable file or the dedicated documentation that describes it, or both. Inputs: Source and target ontologies, requirements, and any business or domain constraints. Outputs: Analysis reports comprising a comparative characterisation table, identified difficulties, risks and amenability assessments, selected source and target for mapping. In the ontology matching lifecycle, the reuse phase is pivotal, because it will facilitate the integration of already existing mappings into the project’s workflow, thereby saving work and positioning one’s ontology better within the extant ecosystem. Following the initial characterisation, this phase entails discovery and evaluation of available mappings against the project’s defined requirements. These requirements are instrumental in appraising whether an existing alignment can be directly adopted, necessitates modifications for reuse, or if a new alignment should be constructed from the ground up. Ontology alignments are often expressed in Alignment Format (AF) or EDOAL. The outcome of this activity can be either of: direct reuse of mappings that are immediately applicable, adaptive reuse where existing mappings provide a partial fit and serve as a basis for refinement of the mapping, and the initiation of a new alignment when existing resources are not suitable. This structured approach to reuse optimises resource utilisation, promotes efficiency, and tailors the mapping process to the project’s unique objectives. Inputs: repository of existing alignments for the source and target ontologies, evaluation criteria based on requirements. Outputs: Assessment report on existing alignments, decisions on reuse, adaptation, or creation of a new alignment. This section summarises automatic and semi-automatic approaches to finding the alignment candidates. In cases of small vocabularies and ontologies, a fully manual effort is likely more efficient. Utilising both automated tools and manual expertise, this phase focuses on identifying potential correspondences between entities in the source and target models. The matching process may employ various methodologies, including semantic similarity measures, pattern recognition, or lexical analysis, to propose candidate alignments. These candidates are then critically evaluated for their accuracy, relevance, and completeness, ensuring they meet the predefined requirements and are logically sound. This stage is delineated into three main activities: planning, execution, and evaluation. In the planning activity, the approach to ontology matching is meticulously strategised. The planning encompasses selecting appropriate methods with their algorithms and tools, fine-tuning parameters, determining thresholds for similarity and identity functions, and setting evaluative criteria. These preparations are informed by a thorough understanding of the project’s requirements and the outcomes of previous reuse evaluations. Numerous well-established ontology matching algorithms have been extensively reviewed in the literature (for a review and in-depth analysis, see OteraEtAl15, EuzenatShvaiko13). The main classes of ontology matching techniques are listed below in the order of their relevance to this handbook: Terminological techniques draw on the textual content within ontologies, such as entity labels and comments, employing methods from natural language processing and information retrieval, including string distances and statistical text analysis. Structural techniques analyse the relationships and constraints between ontology entities, using methods like graph matching to explore the topology of ontology structures. Semantic techniques apply formal logic and inference to deduce the implications of proposed alignments, aiding in the expansion of alignments or detection of conflicts. Extensional techniques compare entity sets, or instances, potentially involving analysis of shared resources across ontologies to establish similarity measures. Following planning, the execution activity implements the chosen matchers. Automated or semi-automated tools are deployed to carry out the matching process, resulting in a list of candidate correspondences. This list typically includes suggested links between elements of the source and target ontologies, each with an associated confidence level computed by the algorithms. EDOAL, a representation framework for expressing such correspondences, is commonly utilised to encapsulate these potential alignments. Finally, in the evaluation activity, the alignments found are rigorously assessed for their suitability. The evaluation measures the alignments against the project’s specific needs, scrutinising their accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the predefined requirements. This assessment ensures that only the most suitable alignments are carried forward for the creation of a mapping, thereby upholding the integrity and logical soundness of the matching process. Tools: Tools such as Silk, LIMES, and LogMap may be used in this stage. Inputs: Matcher configurations, additional resources (if any), correspondences from previous matching iterations. Outputs: Generated alignments, evaluation reports. Following the identification of alignments, this step involves the formal creation of the alignment and the rendering (generation) of specific mappings between the source and target models. This phase encompasses preparation, creation, and rendering activities that solidify the relationships between ontology entities into a coherent mapping that is actionable. The resulting alignment is then documented, detailing the rationale, methods used, and any assumptions made during the mapping process. The alignment process should be considered as part of the governance of a vocabulary or ontology that would include engaging communication with third parties to validate the alignment. Furthermore, the process has technical implications that should be evaluated upfront such as the machine interpretation and execution of the mapping. Preparation involves stakeholder involvement to collectively go systematically through the list of alignments (candidate mappings), considering not only the relevance of the alignments, but also the type of relationship between the elements, being typically either equivalence or subsumption. The type of asset—be it an ontology, controlled list, or data shape—dictates the nature of the relationship that can be rendered from the alignment. The table below lists possible types of alignment and mapping relationship types that can be established. Relation / Element type Property Concept Class Individual = owl:equivalentProperty; owl:sameAs skos:exactMatch; skos:closeMatch owl:equivalentClass; owl:sameAs owl:sameAs > skos:narrowMatch < rdfs:subPropertyOf skos:broadMatch rdfs:subClassOf % owl:propertyDisjointWith owl:disjointWith owl:differentFrom instanceOf rdf:type skos:broadMatch; rdf:type rdf:type rdf:type hasInstance skos:narrowMatch This table is indicative of the variety of semantic connections that can be realised, ranging from equivalence and subclass relations to disjointness and type instantiation. This nuanced approach to the preparation stage is essential in ensuring that the eventual alignment and rendered mapping accurately represent the semantic intricacies of the relationships defined in the project scope, thereby fulfilling the project’s defined requirements. The Creation step is the execution of the mapping, entailing the selection of the relation, and assertion of the mapping This activity involves human intervention and the selection is conducted manually according to the project’s objectives and semantic appropriateness of the candidate mapping. Rendering translates the mapping in a machine-readable format so that it can be interpreted and executed by software agents. Typically, this is a straight-forward export of the alignment statements from the editing tool or the materialisation of the mapping in a triple store, using a common format, such as Alignment Format, EDOAL, Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mapping SSSOM, and the Semantic Mapping Vocabulary SEMAPV for the mapping justification values. Multiple renderings may be created from the same alignment, accommodating the need for various formalisms. Tools: Tools such as VocBench3 can be used in this stage, or generic office tools if the stakeholders so prefer, such as MS Excel, Google Sheets spreadsheets, or a LibreOffice spreadsheet. Inputs: Evaluated correspondences (the alignments), stakeholders' amendment plans, requirements for the formalism of the mapping. Outputs: Created mapping, alignment amendment strategy, stored versions in an alignment repository. The final stage focuses on operationalising the created mappings, ensuring it is accessible and usable by applications that require semantic interoperability between the mapped models. This involves publishing the mappings in the standardised, machine-readable format obtained from Phase 5 and mechanisms for maintaining, updating, and governing the alignment are established, facilitating its long-term utility and relevance. The governance involves the creation of maintenance protocols to preserve the alignment’s relevance over time. This includes procedures for regular updates in response to changes in ontology structures or evolving requirements, as well as governance mechanisms to oversee these adaptations. As the mapping is applied, new insights may emerge, prompting discussions within the stakeholder community about potential refinements or the development of a new iteration of the mapping. The dynamic nature of data sources means that the application stage is both an endpoint, as well as a starting point for continuous improvement. Some processes may be automated to enhance efficiency, such as the monitoring of ontologies for changes that would necessitate updates to the mapping. Inputs: Finalised mappings, application context, feedback mechanisms. Outputs: Applied mappings in use, insights from application, triggers for potential updates, governance actions for lifecycle management.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"map-an-existing-model-guideline","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/map-an-existing-model-guideline.html","titles":[{"text":"Guidelines for how to map existing data models","hash":"_guidelines_for_how_to_map_existing_data_models","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1: Staging","hash":"_phase_1_staging","id":2},{"text":"Phase 2: Characterisation","hash":"_phase_2_characterisation","id":3},{"text":"Phase 3: Reuse","hash":"_phase_3_reuse","id":4},{"text":"Phase 4: Execute the Matching","hash":"_phase_4_execute_the_matching","id":5},{"text":"Phase 5: Validate Alignments","hash":"_phase_5_validate_alignments","id":6},{"text":"Phase 6: Application","hash":"_phase_6_application","id":7}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"Imagine different organisations speaking different dialects of the same language. One might say “Organisation,” another says “LegalEntity.” They’re both talking about similar things—but how do we get them to understand each other? Ontology alignment and mapping helps solve this problem by creating bridges between different models, allowing each organisation to keep their unique vocabulary while ensuring that the meaning is preserved. This tutorial demonstrates how to map the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) to Schema.org, addressing Use Case UC2.1. By following the map an existing model methodology, you’ll learn how to align these two vocabularies step-by-step—covering staging, characterisation, reuse, matching, alignment, and application—to ensure interoperability between the CBV and Schema.org. In this phase, the aim is to understand what needs to be mapped and why. For this tutorial, we aim to map the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) to Schema.org, enabling data interoperability. Determine the purpose of the mapping: What are the key areas of business data that need to be interoperable between CBV and Schema.org? This is carried out in collaboration with stakeholders. Define Scope: What parts of the Core Business Vocabulary need to be mapped to Schema.org? Are there specific concepts (e.g.,Contact Point, Organization, etc.) that must be represented? Which version of each ontology or vocabulary will be mapped? Set mapping Goals: Define the intended outcomes of the mapping, such as ensuring semantic alignment between CBV and Schema.org entities. For example, one key goal may be to clarify the relationship between legal:LegalEntity and schema:Organization (Issue #38) A short project specification listing target concepts and mapping objectives. The purpose, scope, and goals are determined by the stakeholders, including domain experts and knowledge engineers. First, the domain experts’ input is needed to demarcate the scope especially, indicating what the (sub-)topic of interest is, ideally augmented with key terms. For CBV and Schema.org, these may include terms such as: legal:LegalEntity vs. schema:Organization. It may also need to take into account ‘externalities’, such as regulatory compliance that may dictate the use of one version of a schema over another for some business reason. For the current exercise, there are no regulatory compliance requirements in place. Therefore, the latest official releases of both vocabularies will be used (Schema.org version 29.1 and CBV version 2.2.0). Next, clear mapping goals should be established. For this exercise, the primary goal is to identify direct relationships between the two vocabularies. These relationships will then be expressed in a machine-readable format, enabling seamless data transformation from the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) to Schema.org. The aim of this phase is to analyse the structure, vocabulary, and semantics of the Core Business Vocabulary that we shall take as Source ontology and Schema.org that will be set as Target ontology. The key steps and outputs are as follows. Examine both ontologies for: Entity structures, definitions, and formats. Deprecation policies and inheritance mechanisms, natural language(s) used, label specification, label conventions, definition specification, definition conventions, version management and release cycles, etc. A comparison in the form of a table Optionally: a brief report containing a list of obstacles that need to be overcome before model matching can take place First, list the features on which to compare the source and the target, which concerns principally the ‘meta’ information, or: information about the artefacts, rather than its contents about the subject domain. This includes typical features such as the serialisation format(s) in which the artefacts are available, naming conventions of the terminology, and version management. The features can have adverse or facilitating consequences for the mapping task. Let’s consider three of them here and relate them to our case. First, are the files available in the same format? This is indeed the case for CBV and Schema.org, and even leaves the choice for using their RDF or JSON-LD format. The natural language of CVB and Schema.org, that is, the rendering of the entities’ names and labels, are both in one language, and so translating entities’ names is not needed. Regarding frequency of version updates, there is a notable difference. CBV is relatively stable with two main releases, whereas Schema.org has frequent releases and it is currently in its 29th main release cycle. . Second, we list the selected features in a table, and for each feature, find the answer for CBV and Schema.org. For the CBV and Schema.org metadata comparison, we had to consult the documentation, the developer release pages, and inspect the files to obtain the answers. The selected features and comparison with the values is shown in the table below. Feature Core Business Vocabulary Schema.org Specification HTML document HTML document Computer processable formats UML, RDF, JSON-LD, SHACL OWL, RDF (ttl, rdf/xml), CSV, JSON-LD, NQ, NT, SHACL, SHEXJ Inheritance Single inheritance Multiple inheritance Label rdfs:label, shacl:name (within SHACL shapes) rdfs:label Naming scheme CamelCase for classes (e.g., LegalEntity) and lowerCamelCase for properties CamelCase for classes (e.g., EducationalOrganization)and lowerCamelCase for properties Label formatting With spaces (e.g., Legal Entity) In CamelCase Language English English Deprecation No Yes Definitions rdfs:comment, shacl:description within SHACL shapes Written in rdfs:comment Latest version inspected Latest (v 2.0.0, 6-5-2024). 1 or 2 releases per year 29.0 (24-3-2025). 1 or 2 releases per year Developer location https://github.com/SEMICeu/Core-Business-Vocabulary https://schema.org/docs/developers.html The aim of this phase is to avoid doing duplicate work by checking if any existing mappings between CBV and Schema.org are available for reuse or if there are any alignments that can be adapted for this project. Search for Existing Alignments: Looking for any pre-existing alignments that may have been created by others or as part of previous work by consulting the SEMIC GitHub repository for relevant mappings. Evaluate Reusability: Determine whether these existing alignments meet your project’s requirements. If they do, they can be reused directly. Adapt Existing Alignments: If the existing alignments are close but need modification, adapt them to suit the specific project goals. A document listing: which type of alignment was chosen for which existing alignments. The decisions: A new alignment needs to be created. There are three distinct pathways, being direct use, adaptive reuse, and creating a new alignment. Let’s look at each in turn. For the CBV and Schema.org, we first look for pre-existing alignments of related vocabularies. They may be in the files themselves, but we also can search a relevant repository with other files that may have relevant mappings, such the SEMIC GitHub repository in this case, and using alignment frameworks such as EDOAL or SSSOM. From searching through the SEMIC repository, we found several vocabularies that have alignments to Schema.org already, which may be reusable. They are listed in the following table, alongside with the location and at which date we checked the mapping, as it may change with different versions (recall the Source and Target Characterisation, above). Mapping From Mapping To Location Version CBV Schema.org https://github.com/SEMICeu/Semantic-Mappings/tree/main/Core%20Business CBV v2.2.0 – Schema.org v29.1 We then look at the intersection of CBV concepts and relationships with either of these. If so, we check if there is already a mapping from that element to Schema.org. This takes us to the Evaluate reusability step: and if it is an agreeable mapping between the two entities, we can reuse that mapping. Alternatively, it may be the case of adaptive reuse, which involves refinements to better suit the mapping objectives. Example: An existing alignment for LegalEntity to Organization was evaluated. However, it was missing relationships for organizational properties like schema:legalName and schema:taxID. So, the original alignment was extended to include new mappings for these properties. They may also be new alignments when existing resources are not suitable, which is the case for this tutorial. Example: Add alignment to answer the question: What is the relation between legal:LegalEntity and schema:Organization? At this step, we will perform the actual mapping, which we shall bootstrap by producing candidate mappings between classes and between properties, typically automatically,semi-automatically, or manually, and then assess the results. Select Matching Technique: Decide on a method for automatically or semi-automatically matching entities. Perform Matching: Prepare the inputs and use the chosen tool to generate potential matches between CBV and Schema.org entities. Candidate Evaluation: The knowledge engineer assesses the candidate correspondences for their consistency, accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the project’s requirements. List of alignments. In this tutorial, we use LIMES to automate link discovery in the mapping process between the CBV and Schema.org. While other tools could also be used, LIMES was selected for its simplicity and efficiency in performing lexical similarity-based alignments. Preparing the data sources depends on the files and the alignment tool chosen. To determine this, the table of features compiled in Phase 2 is useful: there it lists whether alignment should be run on the class name or the label, the file format, and any other algorithmic peculiarities that may be asked for, such as a similarity threshold. For our use case with CBV and Schema.org and LIMES, we begin by configuring the SPARQL endpoints, which allow us to extract the relevant classes and properties for comparison. We focus on aligning entities by their rdfs:label whose value is the name or description of the entity, which is the most straightforward way to identify potential mappings. LIMES uses a similarity metric to compare the rdfs:label values of entities from both files. This metric generates similarity scores based on the string matching of the labels and, optionally, their descriptions. Tools such as LIMES and Silk do not determine the semantic nature of the match (e.g., equivalence vs. subclass). They only suggest candidate pairs based on similarity metrics. It is up to the human expert to choose the appropriate relation, using knowledge of the domain and the ontology documentation. Once the matching process is complete, we inspect the results. In the case of the CBV and Schema.org alignment, no matches were found with LIMES. This means that the automated tool did not identify any significant similarities between entities based on the chosen similarity metric. Consequently, we need to either try with another alignment tool or manually review and align the entities. While we opt for the latter, let us first illustrate how the output would look if there had been potential matches. For instance, the Core Public Service Vocabulary (CPSV) as source against Schema.org does yield interesting results. LIMES output includes three key columns: Source entity: a URI from the source ontology (e.g., CPSV). Target entity: a URI from the target ontology (e.g., Schema.org). Similarity score: a numerical value (typically from 0 to 1) indicating the strength of the lexical similarity between the two entities. Even though the automated tool did not produce any alignments, we can use our domain knowledge to suggest potential mappings based on the descriptions and attributes of the entities. For example, CBV’s LegalEntity (that is an org:Organization) maps to Schema.org’s Organization based on their similar roles in representing business-related concepts, and likewise for CBV’s Address (imported from Core Location Vocabulary) with Schema.org PostalAddress. These kinds of alignments are made by examining the entity definitions and considering the context of their use in each ontology. After alignments (i.e., candidate mappings) have been generated—whether by automated tools or through manual assessment—each proposed mapping must be validated. This process aims at checking whether the candidate links represent semantically meaningful relationships between classes or properties from the two ontologies. Confirm candidate correspondences with domain experts. Review proposed alignments Decide on the appropriate semantic relation. Common types that we focus on here include: Equivalence: When two entities are conceptually and functionally the same → rendered as owl:equivalentClass or owl:equivalentProperty Subsumption: When one entity is more specific than the other (i.e., subclass or subproperty) → rendered as rdfs:subClassOf or rdfs:subPropertyOf Formalise the alignment into a mapping following conventions from the Alignment format or EDOAL. Render Mappings in a Machine-Readable Format. The mapping file can be rendered in RDF/XML, Turtle, or other formats like JSON-LD, depending on the tool or system in use. The choice of format should align with the needs of the stakeholders and the technical requirements of the project. While RDF/XML is a standard format for machine-readable ontology representations, it may not be ideal for human consumption due to its complexity. However, RDF/XML (or other syntaxes such as Turtle) is often used in formal contexts for consistency and integration with other semantic web tools. If ease of use for human review is desired, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or tools that visualize RDF data can provide a more intuitive way to view and edit mappings. Final alignment in RDF for integration Each candidate correspondence is checked for correctness and relevance. For CBV and Schema.org, we use a manual inspection by ontology engineers first , which includes cross-referencing documentation or definitions. CBV’s LegalEntity is “A self-employed person, company, or organization that has legal rights and obligations.” and Schema.org’s Organization is “An organization such as a school, NGO, corporation, club, etc.”. For Address, the descriptions are as follows: “A spatial object that in a human-readable way identifies a fixed location.” with a usage note indicating it to be understood as a postal address, and “The mailing address.”, respectively. For each validated candidate pair, determine the type of semantic relation. For our running example, CBV’s LegalEntity is almost the same as Schema.org’s Organization, but the latter does not have the “legal rights” constraint, and therefore, the appropriate semantic relation is that of subsumption. For the respective addresses, while CBV’s imported Address’ definition is broader than PostalAddress, and therefore suggesting a subsumption alignment as well, taking into account CBV’s usage note, it can be an equivalence alignment. Once the relation is chosen, each alignment is encoded as a machine-readable RDF triple, typically in RDF/XML or Turtle format, suitable for integration and reuse. The result is a validated alignment file, where each mapping is represented based on the Alignment Format or an extension thereof, such as EDOAL, as an align:Cell with: The aligned entities (align:entity1 and align:entity2) The chosen relation (align:relation), being either subsumption “<” or equivalence “=” An optional confidence measure Its corresponding meaning in the ontology (owl:annotatedProperty) Further information on a mapping justification, which reuses the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mapping SSSOM that, in turn, reuses the Semantic Mapping Vocabulary SEMAPV for the mapping justification values. Example output of adding an alignment between legal:LegalEntity and schema:Organization: http://mapping.semic.eu/business/sdo/cell/21 a align:Cell; align:entity1 http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity; align:entity2 https://schema.org/Organization; align:relation \"<\"; align:measure \"1\"^^xsd:float; owl:annotatedProperty rdfs:subClassOf; sssom:mapping_justification semapv:MappingReview . where it can be seen that the “<” relation corresponds to rdfs:subClassOf and the mapping justification is MappingReview, which is as approved as it can be in SEMAPV terminology. Other alignment examples and a complete file including prefixes can be viewed here. After alignments have been validated, the final step is to apply them in practice. This involves both technical integration and the establishment of a governance framework to ensure the mappings remain up to date and useful over time. Publish the Mappings: Share the mappings in a standard format via a repository. Integrate and Test: Apply the mappingsalignment in semantic web tools or data integration workflows. Establish Governance: Define a process for updating the mappings in response to changes in the source or target ontologies. Published mappings and insights for potential refinements. The mapping file (in RDF/Turtle format) resulting from our mapping exercise is published on the SEMIC GitHub repository. This allows for integration of the mapping output into validation tools used by Member States and other implementers to check CBV-compliant data against Schema.org requirements. For testing, one could attempt to load the files in an editor that can read in file of the chosen format, being Turtle for CBV, the Turtle version of Schema.org, and the alignment file, or run it trough a syntax validator to verify that all is in order for deployment. The governance structure for CBV and its mapping to Schema.org is on the side of CBV that reuses Schema.org. SEMIC is responsible for regularly checking if there are updates in either the CBV vocabulary or Schema.org (e.g., new classes, renamed terms, deprecated elements) and update where needed, see to it that logged issues are addressed, and verify that all links and namespaces still in working order. It may also consider updates to CBV due to changing requirements (e.g., to make CBV multilingual) and plan any consequent updates to CBV and any potential effects it may have on the mappings with Schema.org. To demonstrate the practical value of the mapping between CBV and Schema.org, we use SPARQL Anything to query instance data alongside the alignment file. We assume: A data file (core-business-ap.ttl) contains an instance of legal:LegalEntity An alignment file (Alignment-CoreBusiness-2.2.0-schemaorg.ttl) defines a mapping from legal:LegalEntity to schema:Organization. PREFIX xyz: http://sparql.xyz/facade-x/data/ PREFIX legal: http://www.w3.org/ns/legal# PREFIX align: http://knowledgeweb.semanticweb.org/heterogeneity/alignment# PREFIX rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# CONSTRUCT { ?s a ?entity2 . } WHERE { SERVICE x-sparql-anyhintg:app/core-business-ap.ttl { ?s a ?entity1 . } SERVICE x-sparql-anything:app/Alignment-CoreBusiness-2.2.0-schemaorg.ttl { ?align a align:Cell ; align:entity1 ?entity1 ; align:entity2 ?entity2 . FILTER (?entity1 = legal:LegalEntity) } } It checks for instances of legal:LegalEntity in the data file, and if the alignment file contains a mapping for it, it infers the equivalent or related Schema.org class (schema:Organization). http://example.org/entities/Company123 a https://schema.org/Organization .","title":"UC 2.1 Tutorial on Mapping an existing Model to a Core Vocabulary","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"map-existing-ontology-to-vocabulary","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/map-existing-ontology-to-vocabulary.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Phase 1: Staging (Defining the Requirements)","hash":"_phase_1_staging_defining_the_requirements","id":2},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps","id":3},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output","id":4},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org","id":5},{"text":"Phase 2: Characterisation (Defining Source and Target Data)","hash":"_phase_2_characterisation_defining_source_and_target_data","id":6},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_2","id":7},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_2","id":8},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_2","id":9},{"text":"Phase 3: Reuse of Existing Mappings","hash":"_phase_3_reuse_of_existing_mappings","id":10},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_3","id":11},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_3","id":12},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_3","id":13},{"text":"Phase 4: Matching (Execute and Filter Matching Candidates)","hash":"_phase_4_matching_execute_and_filter_matching_candidates","id":14},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_4","id":15},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_4","id":16},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_4","id":17},{"text":"Set Up Data Sources","hash":"_set_up_data_sources","id":18},{"text":"Apply Matching Algorithm","hash":"_apply_matching_algorithm","id":19},{"text":"Analyse Results","hash":"_analyse_results","id":20},{"text":"Manual Alignment Process","hash":"_manual_alignment_process","id":21},{"text":"Phase 5: Validate Alignments","hash":"_phase_5_validate_alignments","id":22},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps_5","id":23},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_5","id":24},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_5","id":25},{"text":"Review Proposed Alignments","hash":"_review_proposed_alignments","id":26},{"text":"Decide the Appropriate Semantic Relation","hash":"_decide_the_appropriate_semantic_relation","id":27},{"text":"Formalise the Alignment","hash":"_formalise_the_alignment","id":28},{"text":"Phase 6: Application (Operationalise the Mappings)","hash":"_phase_6_application_operationalise_the_mappings","id":29},{"text":"Steps:","hash":"_steps_6","id":30},{"text":"Output:","hash":"_output_6","id":31},{"text":"Procedure for CBV and Schema.org","hash":"_procedure_for_cbv_and_schema_org_6","id":32},{"text":"Real Example Using SPARQL Anything","hash":"_real_example_using_sparql_anything","id":33},{"text":"Scenario","hash":"_scenario","id":34},{"text":"SPARQL Query","hash":"_sparql_query","id":35},{"text":"What This Query Does","hash":"_what_this_query_does","id":36},{"text":"Output","hash":"_output_7","id":37}]},"40":{"id":40,"text":"Use Case UC2.2 focuses on enabling data interoperability by converting XML data into RDF format, ensuring that it adheres to the semantic standards defined by the chosen Core Vocabulary. Specifically, it zooms in on the process of mapping an existing XML Schema Definition (XSD) to a Core Vocabulary. For this tutorial, we will use the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). The procedure involves defining the transformation rules that align data from the existing XSD to the concepts and terms of the Core Vocabulary. . This tutorial guides you through the key steps in creating the mappings to Core Vocabularies (CV) involving: Understanding the XSD Schema and the mapping process; Creating a conceptual mapping between the XSD schema and vocabulary in RDF; Creating the technical mapping; Validating the RDF output; Disseminating the outcome. The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) XSD file defines several key entities for the domain, including: AccountingDocument: Financial and non-financial information resulting from an activity of an organization. BusinessAgent: An entity capable of performing actions, potentially associated with a person or an organization. FormalOrganization and LegalEntity: Legal and formal entities with rights and obligations. ContactPoint: Contact details for an entity, such as email, phone, etc. RegisteredAddress: The address at which the Legal Entity is legally registered. Before initiating the mapping development process,it’s essential to prepare representative test data. This data should align with the structure defined in the XSD schema and cover various use cases and scenarios that might occur in production data. For this tutorial, we will use the SampleData_Business.xml file available on the SEMIC GitHub repository. Ensure that the XML data contains relevant elements, such as , , , and , which you will later map to the Core Business Vocabulary terms. We will create a conceptual mapping between the XSD elements and RDF terms from the Core Business Vocabulary. This will guide the transformation of the XML data to RDF. There are two levels of conceptual mapping: Vocabulary Level Mapping: This is a basic alignment, where each XML element is directly mapped to an ontology class or property. Example: is mapped to cv:RegisteredAddress and is mapped to legal:LegalEntity. Application Profile Level Mapping: At this level, you use XPath expressions to extract specific data from the XML structure, ensuring a more precise mapping to the Core Vocabulary. Example: Mapping the address fields from the XML to a specific property, such as locn:postCode or locn:postName. In both cases, the target is declared in two components: the target property path and the target class path, to ensure it is mapped in the right context. For instance, a locn:postName of a legal entity may well have different components compared to a locn:postName of the address of a physical building. Example of the Conceptual Mapping for the five selected elements of the XSD schema : Source XPath Target Property Path Target Class Path */AccountingDocument ?this a cv:AccountingDocument . cv:AccountingDocument */LegalEntity ?this a legal:LegalEntity . legal:LegalEntity */LegalEntity/LegalName ?this legal:legalName ?value legal:LegalEntity */ContactPoint ?this a cv:ContactPoint . cv:ContactPoint The RDF Mapping Language (RML) is ideal for the task of implementing the conceptual mappings as technical mappings, because it allows for seamless mapping from XML to RDF. We will use RML to create machine-executable mapping rules as follows. First, the rml:logicalSource is declared, with the root of the tree in the XML file, which is */LegalEntity in our use case that assumes there to be an rml:source called SampleData_Business.xml with instance data. Next, a rr:subjectMap is added to say how each node becomes the RDF subject—here we build an IRI from generate-id(.) and type it as legal:LegalEntity. Finally, one or more rr:predicateObjectMap blocks capture the properties we need; in the simplest case we map the child element to the vocabulary property legal:legalName. The complete example RML mapping code looks as follows, in Turtle syntax: @prefix rr: . @prefix rml: . @prefix ql: . @prefix ex: . @prefix : . @prefix xsd: . @prefix legal: @prefix rdfs: . ex:Organization a rr:TriplesMap ; rdfs:label \"Organisation\" ; rml:logicalSource [ rml:source “SampleData_Business.xml” ; rml:iterator \"*/LegalEntity\" ; rml:referenceFormulation ql:XPath ] ; rr:subjectMap [ rdfs:label \"LegalEntity\" ; rr:template \"http://example.cv/resource#Organisation_{generate-id(.)}\" ; rr:class legal:LegalEntity ; ] ; rr:predicateObjectMap [ rdfs:label \"LegalName\" ; rr:predicate legal:legalName ; rr:objectMap [ rml:reference \"LegalEntity/LegalName\" ; ] ] ; . This needs to be carried out for all elements from the XSD that were selected for mapping in Phase 1. Now that we have created the mappings, we can apply them to sample data using RMLMapper or a similar tool selected from the SEMIC Tooling Assistant. For this tutorial, we will use RMLMapper, which will read the RML mapping file and the input XML data, and then generate the corresponding RDF output. The snippet below is a single triple set produced when the mapping is run over the sample file SampleData_Business.xml (see Phase 1). It shows that one of the XML records—the Belgian committee for UNICEF—has been turned into an RDF resource of type legal:LegalEntity with its legal:legalName correctly populated. @prefix legal: . @prefix cv: . @prefix ex: . ex:Organization_1 a legal:LegalEntity ; legal:legalName \"Comité belge pour l'UNICEF\" . We will validate the output in two ways: to check that it exists and the graph and to check that it exists as intended also regarding any constraints on the shape of the graph. You can validate the generated RDF using SPARQL queries to ensure that the transformation adheres to the defined conceptual mapping. Since we want to validate rather than retrieve information, we use SPARQL ASK queries, which will return either a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. For our running example, the SPARQL query for validating the LegalEntity is: ASK { ?e a ; ?name . } SHACL validation can be applied to ensure that the RDF data conforms to the required shapes and structures regarding any constraints that must hold. An example SHACL shape for validating LegalEntity is: To create a SHACL shape for the given RDF output, where the LegalEntity (legal:LegalEntity) has a legalName property, we need to define a SHACL shape that validates the type of the LegalEntity, the presence of the legalName property, and its datatype. @prefix sh: . @prefix cv: . @prefix ex: . @prefix xsd: . @prefix legal: . # Define a shape for LegalEntity ex:LegalEntityShape a sh:NodeShape ; sh:targetClass legal:LegalEntity ; # This shape applies to all instances of LegalEntity sh:property [ sh:path legal:legalName ; # Ensure the presence of the legalName property sh:datatype xsd:string ; # legalName must be a string sh:minCount 1 ; # At least one legalName must be provided ] . Target Class: The shape is applied to all resources of type legal:LegalEntity. This means it validates any LegalEntity instance in your RDF data. Property Constraints: legal:legalName: The property legalName is required to be of type xsd:string, and the minimum count is set to 1 (sh:minCount 1), meaning that the legalName property must appear at least once. Note: The SHACL shapes of the CBV can be found here. Once the mappings are validated, the next step is to disseminate the mapping as a package of documentation together with the artefacts. The package includes: Conceptual Mapping Files: This documents the mapping rules between XSD elements and RDF terms, being the table included above in Phase 2. Technical Mapping Files: These include the RML or code for data transformation, which were developed in Phase 3. Test Data: The representative set of XML files for testing the mappings that were created in Phase 1. Validation Reports: The SPARQL and SHACL validation results obtained from Phase 4.","title":"Tutorial: Mapping the Core Business Vocabulary from XSD to RDF","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"map-xsd-to-cv","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/map-xsd-to-cv.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Phase1: Understand the XSD schema and Preparing the test data","hash":"_phase1_understand_the_xsd_schema_and_preparing_the_test_data","id":2},{"text":"Understanding the XML schema","hash":"_understanding_the_xml_schema","id":3},{"text":"Preparing the Test Data","hash":"_preparing_the_test_data","id":4},{"text":"Phase 2: Create a Conceptual Mapping","hash":"_phase_2_create_a_conceptual_mapping","id":5},{"text":"Phase 3: Create the Technical Mapping","hash":"_phase_3_create_the_technical_mapping","id":6},{"text":"Phase 4: Validate the RDF Output","hash":"_phase_4_validate_the_rdf_output","id":7},{"text":"Explanation:","hash":"_explanation","id":8},{"text":"Phase 5: Dissemination","hash":"_phase_5_dissemination","id":9}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"[eif] New European Interoperability Framework.

Since 2011, the European Commission facilitates international working groups to forge consensus and maintain the SEMIC Core Vocabularies. A short description of these vocabularies is included in the Table below. The latest release of the Core Vocabularies can be retrieved via the SEMIC Support Center [semic] or directly from the GitHub repository [semic-gh]. Vocabulary Description The Core Person Vocabulary (CPV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a person; e.g., the name, gender, date of birth, and location. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing person-related information. The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity; e.g., the legal name, activity, and address. The Core Business Vocabulary includes a minimal number of classes and properties modelled to capture the typical details recorded by business registers. It facilitates information exchange between business registers despite differences in what they record and publish. The Core Location Vocabulary (CLV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. The Location Core Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a location represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry. This specification enables interoperability among land registers and any other ICT based solution exchanging and processing location information. The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) supports the exchange of information between organisations that define criteria and organisations that respond to these criteria by means of evidence. The Core Evidence and Core Criterion Vocabulary (CCCEV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate development of interoperable information systems: the use of common vocabularies to describe criteria and evidence facilitates the development of information systems and improves their interoperability. Create a repository of reusable criteria in machine-readable formats: the use of common vocabularies promotes the creation of a repository of criteria and evidence information. Automate the assessment of criteria: the Core Vocabulary describing the criterion responses allows systems to easily compare the information collected from different parties and enables automatic assessment of the responses for a specific criterion. Automate scoring of responses: weighting criteria, the assessment can be followed by an automated scoring of the responses provided by different parties. Promote cross-border participation in public procurement: the use of the Core Vocabulary for electronic criterion and evidence allows for removing language barriers thereby improving the cross border exchange of information, and the cross-border participation in pan-European selection processes. Calculating statistics: standardising data for criterion, criterion responses and evidence allows calculating statistical information on the most commonly used criteria for a given process, the most relevant evidence, etc. Create a registry of mappings of criteria: using the Core Vocabulary, it is possible to create a registry of mappings to allow cross-checking of the criteria with the evidence of each particular Member State. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary provides a common data model for describing public organisations in the European Union. The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary (CPOV) addresses specific needs of businesses, public administrations and citizens across the European Union, including the following use cases: Facilitate information sharing: the CPOV enables G2G (Government-to-Government), G2B (Government-to-Business) and G2C (Government-to-Citizen) information sharing. Facilitate the development of common information systems: the use of existing data models for the development of common information systems facilitates the development of those systems and improves their interoperability. Linked Open Organograms: the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary has the potential to link organograms to each other and to high-value data sets. Cross border information exchange: the CPOV allows the management of a cross-border repository of public services and organisations. Find a PO by its function: the public organisation portfolio facilitates discovery of which public authorities and departments are responsible for given areas of the public task. Increase efficiency: the CPOV helps to identify where responsibilities and functions are duplicated or overlap. The Core Public Event Vocabulary (CPEV) is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a public event, e.g. the title, the date, the location, the organiser etc. The Core Public Event Vocabulary aspires to become a common data model for describing public events (conferences, summits, etc.) in the European Union. This specification enables interoperability among registers and any other ICT based solutions exchanging and processing information related to public events. The Core Vocabularies are semantic data specifications that are disseminated as the following artefacts: lightweight ontology [sem-sg-wio] for vocabulary definition expressed in OWL [owl2]; loose data shape specification [sem-sg-wds] expressed in SHACL [shacl]; human-readable reference documentation [sem-sg-wdsd] in HTML (based on ReSpec [respec]); JSON-LD [w3c] context definitions [json-ld]; conceptual model specification [sem-sg-wcm] expressed in UML [uml]. The Core Vocabularies are published under the CC-BY 4.0 licence [cc-by]. The Core Vocabularies have been developed following the ‘Process and methodology for developing Core Vocabularies’ [cv-met], which has an open change and release management process , supported by SEMIC, that ensures continuous improvement and relevance to evolving user needs. This process begins with the identification of needs from stakeholders or issues raised in existing implementations. The Working Group members, SEMIC team or community of users propose changes that are thoroughly assessed for their impact and feasibility. Once a change is deemed necessary, it undergoes a drafting phase where the technical details are fleshed out, followed by public consultations to gather wider input and ensure transparency. Following consultations, the changes are refined and prepared for implementation. This stage may involve further iteration based on feedback or additional insights from ongoing discussions. The finalised changes are then formally approved and documented, ensuring they are well-understood and agreed upon by all relevant parties. The release management of Core Vocabularies follows a structured timeline that includes pre-announced releases and public consultation periods to allow users to prepare for changes. Each release includes detailed documentation to support implementation, ensuring users can integrate new versions with minimal disruption. This process not only maintains the quality and relevance of the Core Vocabularies, but also supports a dynamic and responsive framework for semantic interoperability within digital public services. Claiming conformance to Core Vocabularies is an integral part of validating (a) how well a new or a mapped data model or semantic data specification aligns with the principles and practices established in the SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] and (b) to what degree the Core Vocabularies are reused (fully or partially) [sem-sg-reuse]. The conformance assessment is voluntary, and shall be published as a self-conformance statement. This statement must assert which requirements are met by the data model or semantic specification. The conformance statement highlights various levels of adherence, ranging from basic implementation to more complex semantic representations. At the basic level, conformance might simply involve ensuring that data usage is consistent with the terms (and structure, but no formal semantics) defined by the Core Vocabularies. Moving to a more advanced level of conformance, data may be easily transformed into formats like RDF or JSON-LD, which are conducive to richer semantic processing and integration. This level of conformance signifies a deeper integration of the Core Vocabularies, facilitating a more robust semantic interoperability across systems. Ultimately, the highest level of conformance is achieved when the data is represented in RDF and fully leverages the semantic capabilities of the Core Vocabularies. This includes using a range of semantic technologies, adhering to the SEMIC Style Guide, fully reusing the Core Vocabularies, and respecting the associated data shapes.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"semic-core-vocabularies","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/semic-core-vocabularies.html","titles":[{"text":"SEMIC Core Vocabularies","hash":"corevocabs","id":1},{"text":"Representation formats","hash":"sec:representation-formats","id":2},{"text":"Licensing conditions","hash":"sec:licensing-conditions","id":3},{"text":"Core Vocabularies lifecycle","hash":"sec:core-vocabularies-lifecycle","id":4},{"text":"Claiming conformance","hash":"sec:claiming-conformance","id":5}]},"43":{"id":43,"text":"This handbook serves as a practical guide for using Core Vocabularies in various common situations. To provide clear and actionable insights, we have categorized potential use cases into two groups: Primary Use Cases: These are the most common, interesting, and/or challenging scenarios, all thoroughly covered within this handbook. Additional Use Cases: These briefly introduce other relevant scenarios but are not elaborated on in detail in this handbook. Within both groups, we differentiate between use cases focused on the creation of NEW artefacts and those involving the mapping of EXISTING artefacts to Core Vocabularies. For a better overview, we numbered the use cases and organised them into two diagrams, followed by the description of these use cases in two separate subsections, one dedicated to the addressed use cases and one to the use cases that are not addressed in this handbook. The use cases provided in this handbook are written in white-box point of style oriented towards user goals following the classification of [Cockburn99]. We will use the following template to describe the relevant use cases: Use Case : Title of the use case Goal: A succinct sentence describing the goal of the use case Primary Actor: The primary actor or actors of this use case Actors: (Optional) Other actors involved in the use case Description: Short description of the use case providing relevant information for its understanding Example: An example to illustrate the application of this use case Note: (Optional) notes about this use case, especially related to its coverage in this handbook Use Case UC1: Create a new information exchange data model Goal: Create a new standalone data schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. Note: As this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data formats. Use Case UC1.1: Create a new XSD schema Goal: Create a new standalone XSD schema that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new XSD schema that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, an XSD Schema can be used to create and validate XML data to be exchanged between information systems. Example: OOTS XML schema creation procedure [oots] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Create a new XSD schema Use Case UC1.2: Create a new JSON-LD context definition Goal: Create a new standalone JSON-LD context definition that uses terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a new JSON-LD context definition that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, a JSON-LD context definition can be integrated in describing data, building APIs, and other operations involved in information exchange. Example: Core Person Vocabulary [cpv-json-ld], Core Business Vocabulary [cbv-json-ld] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for use cases will be provided in the Create a new JSON-LD context definition section. Use Case UC2: Map an existing data model to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping of an existing (information exchange) data model, to terms from Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to design and create a mapping of an ontology, vocabulary, or some kind of data schema or information exchange data model that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, to terms from CVs. Such a mapping can be done at a conceptual level, or formally, e.g. in the form of transformation rules, and most often will include both. Note: Since this is a more generic use case it will be broken down into concrete use cases that focus on specific data models and/or data formats. Some of those use cases will be described in detail below, while others will be included in the Appendix, which is dedicated to the additional use cases. Use Case UC2.1: Map an existing Conceptual Model to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Create a mapping between the terms of an existing ontology and the terms of Core Vocabularies. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping expressed in Semantic Web terminology (for example using rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, owl:sameAs properties), associating the terms in an existing ontology that defines relevant concepts in a given domain, to terms defined in one or more CVs. This activity is usually performed by a semantic engineer based on input received from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping associates the terms in an existing ontology, which defines relevant concepts within a specific domain, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. The result of the formal mapping can be used later by software engineers to build information exchange systems. Example: Mapping Core Person to Schema.org [map-cp2org], Core Business to Schema.org [map-cb2org], etc. Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing conceptual model section. Use Case UC2.2: Map an existing XSD Schema to a Core Vocabulary Goal: Define the data transformation rules for the mapping of an XSD schema to terms from Core Vocabularies. Create a mapping of XML data that conforms to an existing XSD schema to an RDF representation that conforms to a Core Vocabulary for formal data transformation. Primary Actors: Semantic Engineer Actors: Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer Description: The goal is to create a formal mapping using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. RML or other languages), to allow automated translation of XML data conforming to a certain XSD schema, to RDF data expressed in terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. This use case required definitions of an Application Profile for a Core Vocabulary because the CV alone does not specify sufficient instantiation constraints to be precisely mappable. Such activity can be done by semantic engineers based on input from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping is usually used as the basis for the formal mapping. The conceptual mapping can be a simple correspondence table associating the XML Elements defined in an XSD schema, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. In some cases the creation of the conceptual mapping can be done by the semantic engineers themselves, or even by the software engineers building information exchange systems. Example: ISA2core SAWSDL mapping [isa2-map] Note: A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the Map an existing XSD schema section. The additional use cases are described in the Appendix.","title":"","component":"core-vocs-handbook","version":"SM16-71","name":"use-cases","url":"/core-vocs-handbook/SM16-71/use-cases.html","titles":[{"text":"Use cases","hash":"_use_cases","id":1},{"text":"Primary use cases","hash":"sec:uc1","id":2}]},"44":{"id":44,"text":"The consumers of SEMIC standards specification can be divided into three categories: business users and domain experts, technicians, software engineers, and software architects, the developers software systems implementing the standards, the machines The SEMIC goal is to bring these groups together, help them \"speak the same language\" and share meaning and conceptual references. Besides the very useful and much needed alignment of domains experts on what concepts mean, it is necessary to bridge the gap between domain experts and the technical experts who implement information systems. Then, the domain experts and business users shall interact with the information systems using the very same set of concepts, agnostic to and undistorted by the technology in the implementation process. Standard semantic data specifications fulfil the purpose keeping these three groups in sync. Ultimately, if the systems are based on standards the purpose is to build interoperable machines - machines that share data with each other and are able to operate on them seamlessly. The developers implement those machine interactions, and therefore the machines and developers must \"find a common language\". However, in order to ensure that the developers take the appropriate steps, the business/domain experts have to interact with them and convey their domain knowledge. This closes the loop: that the machine interactions correspond with the business/domain expert expectations. The data specification shall address the following information needs: visual representation, textual description, machine interpretable representation, and optionally additional representations that facilitate and promote adoption. The aim of this style guide is to ensure the creation of coherent data specifications that can be read and used by domain experts, developers and machines. It is mainly meant for the editors of the data specifications (e.g. semantic engineers, data architects, knowledge modelling specialists). Such data specifications are primarily developed in collaboration with domain experts. To achieve synergy with the domain experts, graphical representation is an indispensable medium that facilitates knowledge elicitation, ideation and knowledge organisation. This becomes especially relevant when shared conceptualisation needs to be attained within a Working Group. The successful application of an ontology or the development of an ontology-based system depends not merely on building a good ontology but also on fitting this into an appropriate development process and implementation into an information system. Generally, computing information models suffer from the intertwining of two types of semantic concerns. As George Box said, \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\", and what a model is useful for depends on what concern it is primarily addressing. On the one hand, the model represents (purely) the domain; on the other hand, it represents the implemented system, which encompasses a representation of the domain (domain knowledge intertwined with technical specificities). These different representation requirements place different demands upon its structure [partridge13]. For example, the concept of \"location\" can be described by domain experts (in a domain model) in a way that is not isomorphic to how the \"location\" class may be appropriately modelled for an information system (i.e., captured in an Implementation Model). One of the common ways to manage this problem is by separating concerns. We take inspiration from OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [mda], which is a well-documented structure where a model is built for each concern, which is transformed into a different model for a different concern. This approach is adapted to the SEMIC needs. Transformation deals with producing different models, viewpoints, or artefacts from a model based on a transformation pattern. In general, transformation can produce one representation from another or cross levels of abstraction or architectural layers [mda-guide]. The Core Vocabularies (CVs) and the specialised Application Profiles (APs) aim to address the following concerns: Domain experts need to agree on the definitions of concepts, relations and their organisation to form a coherent domain model expressed with varying levels of details and expressivity [SC-R2], a shared conceptualisation. This is addressed with conceptual models expressed in UML. The shared conceptualisation needs to be explicitly represented in a usable format (i.e. operated on) by the machines. This is addressed with lightweight ontologies expressed in OWL 2. In practice, to achieve interoperability, it is necessary to provide a (minimum and necessary) set of constraints supporting the ontology instantiation. This is addressed with data shapes expressed in SHACL. To facilitate reuse and understanding, a specification shall be accessible to the community as clear, complete and well-articulated documentation. This is addressed with data specification documents expressed in HTML. In addition, when multiple artefacts addressing each concern are produced, keeping them in synch is a serious editorial and maintenance burden that needs to be considered. On the editorial side the artefacts composing a data specification need to be kept in sync. A modification done in one shall pervade and propagate in all others. This is a difficult, tedious and expensive activity if such synchronisation is to be done manually. Experience shows that using a pivot representation as a single source of truth is a viable solution. Such representation needs to be expressive enough to fulfill all the information needs of the derived artefacts. UML conceptual models can be used as the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. This means it is sufficiently expressive to capture multiple modelling aspects/concerns simultaneously. The other artefacts are then fully or partially derived from the conceptual model. With UML as the single source of truth, the update process is easier to perform as it only has to be done in a single place. The other representations are automatically derived from the conceptual model; the maintenance is less error-prone, uniform and easy [Transformation]. This approach facilitates consistent maintenance of semantic data specification interrelationship and solves the editorial synchronisation problem. However, using UML is not enough, by itself, as the risk of ambiguity and multiple interpretations of the meaning of the UML model elements used in the conceptual model still exists. This risk is mitigated by adopting precise interpretation rules, such as the ones provided in this style guide [CMC-R2]. The different concerns that each data specification is trying to address might lead to different interpretations of the same UML constructs. Therefore, [CMC-R2] defines only a minimal set of such interpretation rules (that can be further extended, if necessary). Additionally, UML cannot cover all potential needs specific to each derived representation. Therefore, the scope of this architecture is limited by what can be expressed in UML and how that information is utilised to generate formal statements. But from our experience it is sufficient to cover all the needs of establishing semantic interoperability standards. Relations between the artefacts are depicted in the figure above. The conceptual model is the source from which a) the data shapes, b) the formal ontology and c) the data specification document can be generated. Each artefact in the figure is qualified with two terms, the representation standard and the most characteristic feature. The conceptual model is expressed in UML language and shall be conformant with the conventions provided in this style guide and the interpretation rules [CMC-R2]. The formal ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language and shall be lightweight as indicated in this convention [SC-R2]. The data shape is expressed in SHACL language and is characterised by the appropriate level of permissiveness [DSC-R2]. The documentation is represented in HTML format and the wording used shall be as precise as possible to capture the meaning accurately and clearly express the intention of the authors. Although not shown in this diagram, the generation of other artefacts is not excluded. For example, more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity) can also be included in the data specification as additional artefacts (see note on [SC-R2]). The figure above depicts that it is also possible to derive from the conceptual model additional artefacts, such as the XSD or JSON schemas and JSON-LD context definitions. These, however, are not addressed in this style guide. One condition the conceptual model shall satisfy is that it shall comply with a set of pre-established conventions (general conventions and UML conventions) and have a fixed interpretation [CMC-R2]. The guidelines in this document enable and constrain the transformation process, making it precise enough to implement a toolchain that automatically performs conformance checking and necessary transformation operations. How this is done, however, is beyond the scope of this document, and the reader may refer to SEMIC toolchain [semic] or other similar implementations such as model2owl [model2owl] or OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain] projects. For any given data specification, various concerns shall be addressed separately, each in a dedicated artefact type. Therefore, the CVs or APs shall be published as a set of artefacts, each addressing a specific concern. The union of these artefacts forms the intended semantic data specification [What is a semantic data specification?]. The table below summarises which artefacts shall be published for each type of data specification addressed in the SEMIC context. Conceptual model (UML) Ontology (OWL 2) Data shape (SHACL) Specification document (HTML) Model diagram (PNG) Core Vocabulary Mandatory Mandatory Optional (shall be permissive) Mandatory Optional (recommended) Application Profile Mandatory Optional (shall be an extension) Mandatory Mandatory Optional (recommended) The semantic data specifications, both CVs and APs, are conceived as a union of specification artefacts, each addressing a different aspect/concern: conceptual model expressed in UML formal ontology expressed in OWL 2 data shapes expressed in SHACL data specification document realised in HTML conceptual model diagrams expressed in any image format (PNG, for example) In the SEMIC context two types of data specifications are of main concern (a) Core Vocabularies designed with broad interoperability goals and (b) Application Profiles designed with application oriented interoperability goals. In this document, we will refer to these data specification types to provide guideline refinements depicting variations based on the data specification type. The primary concern and the intention in each of them differ as follows: Core Vocabularies aim at establishing the shared vocabulary as a lightweight ontology essentially, and optionally some data shapes if necessary [Core Vocabulary]. Application Profiles aim at setting carefully designed data shapes on reused concepts from one or several existent ontologies and, optionally, a minimal ontology with specialised vocabulary [Application Profile]. The secondary concerns are present and common in both data specification types and are, in fact, instrumental to consistent production, maintenance and publication: Editing of the conceptual model Production of data specification document The data specification’s artefacts are not independent but tightly interrelated and transformed from one form into another one. It is difficult to draw a clear line between semantic and technical interoperability artefacts and concerns. This section aims at providing some guidelines and hints on how to distinguish between the two (but no guidelines on technical artefacts are considered as this is out of scope of this work). The best way to look at them is in terms of concerns addressed within each layer, which resembles a lot the discussion on distinguishing \"Conceptual Data Models\", \"Logical Data Models\" and \"Physical Data Models\" in ANSI [ansi] from 1975. EIF [eif] defines the technical interoperability as covering the applications and infrastructures linking systems and services. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to: interface specifications, interconnection services, data integration services, data presentation and exchange, secure communication protocols, access boundaries, information boundaries, etc. The technical layer deals with how to represent, how to transmit data, how the data/entities are bundled when served by a service (i.e. API design or transmission, with impact on performance, usability, and interface), what are the access rights, how is the security ensured, access and storage performance, interfacing with the service, usability, etc. EIF defines the semantic interoperability as ensuring that precise (format and) meaning of exchanged data and information is understood throughout exchanges between parties: \"what is sent is what is understood\". It covers two aspects: semantic and syntactic. The semantic aspect refers to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them. The syntactic aspect refers to describing the exact format of the information to be exchanged in terms of grammar and format. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to developing vocabularies and define data meaning in exchanges. This layer is agnostic to access right, security, transmission protocol, physical representation, how it is presented to the user, etc. In the SEMIC context, Semantic Web and Linked Data technology standards are chosen by default. This means that the syntactic aspect is covered by the RDF specifications [rdf], whereas the semantic aspect is addressed within the Core Vocabulary and Application Profile, expressed in OWL 2 [owl2] and SHACL [shacl] languages. Connecting the semantic layer and the technical layers may not always be straightforward. Three types of technical artefacts are of a particular importance, which rely on three different technologies: XML and XSD, JSON and JSON schema, and relational databases. We briefly comment on each below. RDF. In case the system is gnostic of Semantic Web technologies, if the implementation uses RDF natively, then the technical layer is (near) isomorphic to the semantic specification. There is a perfect alignment. JSON. When system implementation is based on JSON representations, a mapping shall be provided to establish semantics-syntax alignment. Luckily, how such an alignment is done is already specified in the JSON-LD standard specification [json-ld]. It contains a canonical mapping algorithm. The syntaxt semantic binding is provided by the so-called context definitions. As a consequence, if the JSON structure is ought to be aligned with the semantic specification, it imposes a strong constraint on how it shall be organised, otherwise the mapping is not possible. So, an advantage of JSON-LD is that the semantics gets coupled nicely with the syntax, and it is in the reach of the developer. XML. When the system implementation is based on XML representation, then the interplay between syntax and semantics is more problematic, as there is NO canonical way os linking the two. The only transformation we have is the XSLT [xslt] but no mapping language exists like in the case of JSON-LD. Hence, if one provides a mapping to an XSD schema, then one must also provide the XSLT specification that interprets that mapping. Furthermore, when we want to establish an alignment between syntax and semantics there is no constraint on the structure (like in the case of JSON). It is only good practices and alternative technologies, such as RML, that we can rely on in this case. [rml]. RDB. If the implementation is based on relational databases, the story is similar to the XML. There is no organic way of mapping syntax and semantics. The mapping is at the level of the database schema, and there is no canonical way of doing this. So, just like in the case of XML we rely on good practices and alternative technologies to encode an interpretation, such as D2RML [d2rm] and RML [rml]. Ideally, syntax-binding artefacts that show how to map from a semantic data specification into technical layer artefacts is also provided as part of the specification. Showing how to interface with the semantic layer is especially important when Application Profiles (and Implementation Model specifications) are developed and published.","title":"Architectural clarifications","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"arhitectural-clarifications","url":"/style-guide/develop/arhitectural-clarifications.html","titles":[{"text":"Consumer context","hash":"_consumer_context","id":1},{"text":"Editorial context","hash":"_editorial_context","id":2},{"text":"Separation of concerns and transformation","hash":"sec:separation-of-concerns-and-transformation","id":3},{"text":"Separation of concerns in SEMIC","hash":"sec:separation-of-concerns-in-SEMIC","id":4},{"text":"Editorial synchronisation problem","hash":"_editorial_synchronisation_problem","id":5},{"text":"Transformation of the conceptual model","hash":"sec:transformation","id":6},{"text":"Data specification and artefact types","hash":"sec:data-specification-and-artefact-types","id":7},{"text":"Artefact types","hash":"sec:artefact-types","id":8},{"text":"Data specification types","hash":"sec:data-specification-types","id":9},{"text":"Technical artefacts and concerns","hash":"sec:technical-concerns-and-artefacts","id":10}]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"In the Semantic Web literature, the term \"reuse\" appears very often, encouraging the adoption of data specifications in new data specifications rather than redefining the same/similar concepts once again. The term \"reuse\" is usually considered in a broad sense, and what it means in terms of specific implementations is often left underspecified. In this section, we aim to address this gap and provide a detailed account of what \"reuse\" means in the SEMIC context. Specification reuse is the act of sourcing an established specification into a new one (referred to as the \"current\" or \"own\" specification). Technically, reuse may mean either or both of the following: Importing (using owl:imports) the contents of another ontology or data shape specification into a current one; OR relying on URI dereferencing to get the formal definition of the ontology (this, however, does not work for the data shapes) In the SEMIC context, for the purpose of interoperability, we need to carefully constrain the meaning of the term \"reuse\" with a fine-grained description on a construct-by-construct basis, and this is the aim of the remainder of this section. The following subsections offer a systematic description of six cases of reuse based on what is reused: (a) a class or (b) a property, and types of frequently encountered variations: (i) as-is, (ii) with terminological adaptations, and (iii) with semantic adaptations. In each case, we describe as appropriate the implications on the following aspects: How to denote it: (a) as-is or (b) as a specialisation Label Definition Impact of adding new properties (for classes only) Impact of reusing original properties (for classes only) Impact on domain and range (for properties only) Other constraints and additional information This scenario applies when the original class is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed New properties on the class In data shapes (SHACL), the class can be used for in domain/range property constraints. In UML, properties are depicted as new connections (object properties) that are incoming and outgoing to the class or as new attributes (data properties) that appear in the class. This works because OWL 2 semantics treats properties as first-class citizens (along with classes, datatypes and individuals). So even if the UML class diagram may visualise new properties on the class, they shall be read as constructs defined separately from one another, just as the OWL 2 specification defines it [owl2]. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Also, make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification In OWL 2 & SHACL, when reusing a class as-is from an established ontology hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class are considered adopted (even if some may be irrelevant). It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In UML, all properties marked as mandatory in the original data specification are considered relevant and shall be depicted. Optional properties may be depicted only if relevant in the new context. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for reuse. This scenario applies when the original class is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-class that captures the adaptations is recommended as the safe option. Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics must stay the same. Differentiation through using preferred and alternative labels is a strong recommendation and should be implemented as described below. In UML, - the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) - the (original) URI of the reused class shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) - the original label of the reused concept shall be preserved (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, - the original label is adopted as is (e.g. either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) - the new label is added as an alternative label (e.g. skos:altLabel) In the documentation, - the new label displayed as the main label (in titles and any other fronting) - the original label (to be visibly mentioned) Definition NO change allowed Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g. skos:scopeNote). New properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Original properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Example For example, the wording of FOAF definitions can benefit from light adaptations and adjustments, yet the meaning is not changing. Hence, in Core Person Vocabulary, the definitions are slightly adjusted. Such adaptations might be made when the original label or definition does not follow the guidelines laid out in this document. For example, the one on circular definitions [GC-R5]. This scenario applies when the original class is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Must reuse as a specialisation. Must create a subclass that captures the adaptations and indicate reuse by the subclass relationship. If the reused class is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused class Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the reused class New properties on the class Add new properties as necessary on the new (owned) sub-class. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification When reusing a class as-is from a data specification, hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class should be adopted. In UML, include all properties and constraints in the UML diagram if marked as mandatory in the original. For the sake of brevity, optional properties and constraints can be omitted. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for the purpose of reuse. If a reused original property must be made more specific or nuanced, then it is a good idea to create a sub-property of the already existing one. See property reuse recommendations below. Example For example, in the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary, the reused class org:Organisation is specialised as cv:PublicOrganisation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed Domain and range If the reused property * does not define a domain and range (in the original ontology) AND * its definition does NOT mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape) then it can be attached in UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) to any class either as a) a relation (pointing to another class) or b) as an attribute with a specific datatype. If the reused property * defines a domain and range (in the original ontology) OR * its definition DOES mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape), then it must be reflected in the UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) accordingly, i.e. it can be applied only on specified classes. When UML is transformed into other representations, it is not recommended to represent the domain/range definitions in the lightweight ontology (OWL 2). Still, it may be reflected in data shape definitions (SHACL) as constraints. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocs, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but better reflect them as constraints in SHACL, where necessary (i.e. optional properties can stay free of domain/range specification) [CS-R2]. Note: in the case of narrow reuse intention, as for the application profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range constraints in the data shape definitions (using SHACL) even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information When reusing a property as-is from a data specification, then all constraints associated with the property should be adopted. It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In no way should the UML contain conflicting constraints compared to the original data specification. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-property that captures the adaptations is recommended as a safe option, however. If the reused property, is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model, and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics MUST stay the same. We strongly recommend differentiating between preferred labels and alternative labels and should be implemented as described below. In UML, * the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) * URI of the reused property shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) * the original label of the reused concept shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, * original label (as is, either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) * new label (as an alternative label, skos:altLabel) In the documentation, * original label (to be visibly mentioned) * new label (in titles and any other fronting) Definition Changes are NOT allowed. Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g., skos:scopeNote ). Domain and range Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Other constraints and additional information Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Example For example, in DCAT-AP the reused property adms:status is relabeled from \"status\" to \"change type\" for Catalogue Record class. Note that the diagram does not reflect this, but it is reflected in the associated documentation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Must create a sub-property that captures the adaptations. In UML, a connector is created denoting a new property, which specialises another connector denoting the original property. Additionally, notes or hyperlinks shall be provided to the original source. Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused property Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the one of the reused property Domain and range If the reused super property does NOT define domain/range, then it is possible to add domain/range specifications to the sub-property, but only if justified and absolutely necessarily. In UML, feel free to attach it anywhere needed. If the reused super property DOES define a domain/range, DO not override them, i.e. do not specify a new domain/range that leads to logical inconsistencies. Specifically, if you do that, then make sure that the new Domain is a subclass of the Original Domain. If the property is used across multiple classes multiple domain/range specifications can be deemed appropriate. This shall be handled with care. Multiple domain/range definitions in OWL 2 mean intersection (i.e. joined by logical AND) and not the union (i.e. joined by logical OR), as most use cases may require. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocabularies, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but optionally reflect them as permissive constraints in SHACL. In case of narrow reuse intention, as for the Application Profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range specifications in the data shape definitions even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information Feel free to provide any additional information that is deemed necessary. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. Example For example, in the DCAT-AP the reused property dct:hasPart is specialised as dcat:dataset.

This implies: Standard representation of the UML, such as XMI Existence of a well-defined set of rules and conventions to transform UML model into other artefacts, which can be executed, as much as possible automatically, by a dedicated software tool or toolchain [CMC-R2] It is recommended that recent versions of the UML (v2.5+) and XMI (v2.5+) specifications are used [epo-cmc, sec 4.1]. Title: Fixed UML interpretation Identifier CMC-R2 Statement: The UML conceptual model must have a fixed interpretation. Description: Using UML as a graphical language to encode a data specification according to the reuse guidelines requires defining a set of pre-established conventions on the UML notation to reach a fixed interpretation. The interpretation of UML as a logical structure, including OWL 2, was and still is an active research topic. But even the OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel [omg-onto] does not address the notion of reuse. The goal of using UML is to provide for the SEMIC semantic data specifications a standard graphical notation, which many are familiar with. Therefore, the graphical notation should facilitate the understanding of the data specification. The UML notation should match the semantics that are to be expressed in the data specification (the ontology, data shapes and human-readable documentation). The UML is the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. Using the conventions and associated interpretation expressed in this rule, other artefacts are derived from the UML. The benefit of defining such a precise set of mapping rules is that it allows for: Implementing tools to transform UML into derivative artefacts, thus enabling UML as the single source of truth. Implementing tools for formal checking against the established conventions (interpretation), thus enforcing correctness, conformance and consistency. These rules will increase the coherency of the UML diagrams across projects and organisations. Within SEMIC, the interpretation is implemented by the SEMIC toolchain [semic]. The table below provides recommended interpretations of UML elements in OWL 2 and SHACL. These interpretations can be considered high-level mapping rules implementable into transformation tools that generate OWL 2 ontology and, respectively, SHACL constraints from the UML conceptual model.

Examples: The UML interpretation applied by the SEMIC toolchain is described in [semic-toolchain]. To assist the editor while data modelling to choose the best representation, a test suite is available covering all modelling patterns. The SEMIC toolchain shares the same interpretation as the OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain]. In the context of eProcurement ontology, a toolchain has been developed to transform and validate UML models. Such tools are based on two documents: UML convention specifications [epo-cmc] and UML transformation specifications [epo-cm2owl]. Title: Element names and URIs Identifier CMC-R3 Statement: All UML Element names should be fit for URI generation with clear namespace organisation. Description: This convention aims at ensuring that URIs can be generated from UML Element names and shall be treated as an extension to the terminology style conventions [GC-R4]. The Element names are intended as human-readable denominations (called labels) and as machine-readable denominations (called identifiers). This means that the Element names serve as the primary source for generating URIs [puri-bp] to ensure unambiguous machine-readable reference to a formal construct. serve as the primary source for generating labels to ensure human readers' comprehension follow an organisation of namespaces Thus, in the UML model, the Element names must conform to RDF [rdf] and XML [xml] format specifications. Both languages effectively require that terms begin with an upper or lower case letter from the ASCII character set or an underscore (_). This tight restriction means that, for example, terms may not begin with a number, hyphen or accented character [cv-meth]. Although underscores are permitted, they are discouraged as they may be, in some cases, misread as spaces. A formal definition of these restrictions is given in the XML specification document [xml]. Note that, when the UML Element name cannot be used to effectively denominate and identify the concept then, UML Element Tags may be used to express explicitly URIs, labels, notes and other types of annotations [CMC-R6]. Internationalisation, if required, should be provided through the use of the UML Element Tags to specify labels that will be used for generation of specification documents in languages other than English. Country specific data specifications, which are meant to be used primarily at a national level, might decide to relax on this convention and permit the use of Unicode characters in the Element names, which will result in the generations of IRIs, instead of URIs [iri]. However, this is unnecessary, and strongly discouraged, in the SEMIC context. Following this convention is also important in the context of generation of persistent URIs [PC-R2] according to the principles laid out in [10rules-puri]. Examples: The class Address in Core Location has several properties. All the properties have a displayed name (e.g. \"addressArea\") with the UML class diagram and associated UML Tags, such as a label for the HTML specification (\"address area\"), definition, usage note and the related URI. Title: Case sensitivity and charset Identifier CMC-R4 Statement: All UML Element names are case-sensitive and shall follow the CamelCase convention. Description: The names begin with an upper or lower case letter (A–Z, a–z) for all terms in the model. Digits (0–9) are allowed in the subsequent character positions. [epo-cmc, sec 4.2] Moreover, we can significantly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent capitalisation for concept names; therefore, UML Element names shall be CamelCased [epo-cmc, sec 3.2], [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.20]. The names of UML Classes shall start with an upper-case letter, UML Attributes shall start with a lower-case letter, UML Connectors (including Target Roles and Source Roles) shall start with a lower-case letter. The names of UML Enumerations, Packages and Datatypes may start with a lower-case or upper-case letter. Examples: In the image below, there are two classes from Core Location with the related properties and a relation between them. The name of the classes are in UpperCamelCase, the name of the properties are in lowerCamelCase and the relation (adminUnit) is in lowerCamelCase. Title: Namespaces and prefixes in element names Identifier CMC-R5 Statement: Element names shall be organised by namespaces. Namespaces may be indicated through prefixes delimited by colon (:) character, forming qualified names. Description: To enable the reuse of names defined in other models, and the reuse of unique references for names that support easy identification, namespace management must be considered. We adopt the XML and RDF approach to defining and managing namespaces [xml-ns]. A namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organise objects of various kinds so that these objects may be referred to by name and uniquely identifiable [urn]. A qualified name denotes the URI, which is composed of concatenating the expanded prefix with the local segment [turtle]. A qualified name is a name subject to namespace interpretation [xml-ns]. Syntactically, they are either prefixed names or un-prefixed names. A binding declaration shall be maintained, which binds prefixes to namespace URIs and a default namespace applicable to un-prefixed Element names. As the Element name is the primary source for deriving URIs, a base URI and a local segment are necessary. The Element name prefix, before the colon, plays the role of namespace name indicating which base URI shall be used, while the Element name, after the colon, is the local segment. See [xml-ns] for more info. In case the editor decides to omit to specify a prefix in the Element name when a URI generation logic is devised, an implicit prefix can be assumed by default. The qualified names may be structured as follows: prefix:localSegment :localSegment localSegment Note: The prefixes and namespaces shall be well-defined, maintained, and published as part of the data specification. Examples: When dcat a namespace name is declared as bound to base URI http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#, then dcat:Catalog is the qualified name from which the http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Catalog URI is interpreted. When cv (short for Core Vocabularies) namespace name is declared bound to base URI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/, then cv:adminUnit is the qualified name from which the http://data.europa.eu/m8g/adminUnit URI is generated. Title: Rich annotations through tags Identifier CMC-R6 Statement: UML Tags can be conveniently used for annotating the Elements. Description: UML Element tags are key-value pairs that are associated with a UML Element (class, attribute, connector, etc.). The tags can be used as an extension mechanism to the UML language. They can be used to provide information that is not expressible anywhere else on a UML Element. For example, in this style guide, we recommend that the UML Element name shall be used to derive both the concept URI and the concept preferred label. However, if the model editor chooses to use the UML Element name for deriving the concept label alone, then the URI needs to be specified elsewhere. This is one example of how the UML tags can be used: simply specify a new tag, \"uri\", and provide the concept URI as a value (see figure below). Another example where tags came in handy is the provisioning of notes of various types. According to the UML standard, UML Elements have only one general description. We recommend using this description solely for definitions. Yet the scope notes, examples, alternative labels, and any other annotations can be provisioned through the UML tagging mechanism (see figure below). Examples: Title: Explicit depiction of external dependencies Identifier CMC-R7 Statement: The UML diagrams should depict how the developed model relates to external (reused) models. Description: UML does not support an import mechanism comparable to the one specified in OWL 2. Yet, the reuse of models is a highly encouraged practice. To accommodate such practice, the reused Elements shall be created as in the original model and depicted in diagrams. The external Elements shall be clearly marked. The easiest way to do so is by providing a namespace prefix. The original meaning shall be preserved without changes to the labels, concept definitions or URIs. Reused classes shall be depicted in the UML diagrams. Reused properties shall be depicted in diagrams as connectors and attributes. It is not necessary to depict unused classes or properties [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.7]. Examples: In the example below, a Core Vocabulary Person includes concepts from another vocabulary (FOAF); thus the two classes Person and Agent have the \"foaf\" namespace prefix specified in front. Please note that this is an example of reuse with semantic adaptation. In CPV the Person is more restricted than that in FOAF. The foaf:Person class represents people. Something is a foaf:Person if it is a person, and it does not matter whether they are alive, dead, real or imaginary. The foaf:Person class is a subclass of the foaf:Agent class, since all people are considered 'agents' in FOAF. In contrast to that, cpv:Person is defined differently: A individual human being who may be dead or alive, but not imaginary. Hence, the subclass relation. Title: Class inheritance Identifier CMC-R8 Statement: Ensure that the attributes and associations of a superclass apply to all its subclasses. Description: This is a general modelling principle that should be respected, yet when it comes to reusing, such a requirement is often overlooked. This means that the model editor shall carefully analyse the reused model as a whole and how it is integrated with their own model. Examples: In Core Business Vocabulary, the class LegalEntity is a subclass of org:FormalOrganization from the Organization Ontology (which is a subclass of org:Organization, which is a subclass of foaf:Agent), and different properties/relations have been inherited such as hasSubOrganization, hasMember, name, type. See more [oslo-rules sec 3.2.3] Title: Abstract classes Identifier CMC-R9 Statement: Classes that are not intended to be instantiated directly can be marked as abstract. Description: When a (super-)class is created for capturing a level of abstraction in the domain knowledge, it may not always be suitable for instantiation. Editors may choose to mark such classes as abstract and to indicate that their subclasses shall be used in practice. In UML, this can be done via > stereotype [see CMC-R17: Using stereotypes]. Doing so has no impact on the OWL 2 [owl2] representation of the model (as this cannot be expressed in OWL). However, depending on the toolchain implementation, SHACL data shapes [shacl] can be generated to express that no instances of this class shall not occur in the data. See [oslo-rules sec 3.2.6, epo-cmc, sec 4.4] Examples: Both OSLO [oslo-toolchain] and ePO [epo] toolchains support such stereotypes. Title: Attribute definition and usage Identifier CMC-R10 Statement: UML Attributes shall be used to define properties taking simple datatype values. An attribute declaration should specify its datatype and multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: We recommend atomic types are used as attribute types and avoid using another class as the attribute type. Instead, those should be expressed as relationships (represented by Association connectors) between the two classes [CMC-R12]. The reason for this is to keep a clear separation between (a) properties that take a literal value (governed by a datatype, and conceptually corresponding to owl:DatatypeProperty) and (b) properties that take a reference value (governed by a class, corresponding to owl:ObjectProperty). Doing so has two advantages: (a) it confers homogeneity to the model, which enhances readability and decreases ambiguity; (b) the toolchain implementation is easier as there is a clear treatment and interpretation. literal properties (expressed as attributes datatypes) and relations between two classes (expressed as association connectors). The advantage of In case of primitive datatypes, high preference shall be given to using OWL 2 compliant XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf] standard datatypes. For more detailed recommendations on the use of primitive datatypes see convention [CMC-R18]. Properties whose values come from a controlled vocabulary or authority table constitute a special case, because two modelling practices are recognised here: (a) as attributes with type \"Code\", and (b) as dependency relations pointing to a UML Enumeration named after the controlled list. In the first case, the attribute type \"Code\" shall be mapped to the skos:Concept class. The advantage of this approach is the compactness of the diagrams, as fewer boxes appear in them. The disadvantage is the omission to specify precisely, which list the property values are restricted to. Arguably, the controlled list can be provided via the additional UML Tags [CMC-R6], but that value will not be visible in the diagrams. In the second case, the property is modelled not as an attribute but by using a UML Dependency connector between the UML Class, and the UML Enumeration representing the controlled list, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It denotes that the OWL 2 class has an owl:ObjectProperty whose range is of type skos:Concept and is limited to values of the specified controlled vocabulary. The connector must have a \"Source→Target\" direction. No other directions are acceptable, and a valid target role name and multiplicity shall be provided [CMC-R14]. Finally, we emphasise that UML Connectors are reserved for the object properties only. Hence, none shall be established between a UML Class element and a UML Datatype element. Examples: Here we provide an example for the two approaches of specifying attribute datatypes described above. In the CCCEV specification, the class attributes of the Requirement and Evidence classes use loose UML and other datatypes: String, Literal, and Code. No precise definition of what they mean is provided. The attributes are left underspecified, and with generic datatypes: the description attribute is a generic String, while the type and confidentialityLevelType attributes are specified as Code (without explicitly indicating what this datatype means). It is also not clear what would be the difference between Literal and String, although one might gain an intuition from the attribute names. The same classes are reused in the ePO ontology, where the cccev:Requirement and cccev:Evidence class attributes explicitly specify standard datatypes and cardinalities. Additionally, the cccev:confidentialityLevelType attribute, and also the cccev:type attribute, although not depicted in the screenshot, indicated in the original specification, were converted to dependency connectors, because they are not using an atomic datatype, but rather a controlled list of skos:Concept(s) coming from controlled vocabularies, such as at-voc:confidentiality-level. Title: Multiplicity of attributes and connectors Identifier CMC-R11 Statement: The multiplicity of connectors and class attributes should be specified, indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. The cardinality shall be as permissive as possible in Core Vocabularies and as restrictive as necessary in Application Profiles. Description: If the UML model is developed to represent a Core Vocabulary, then the property cardinality (both UML Attributes and UML Association) shall be as permissive as possible, for example, [0..*], meaning any occurrence is allowed. If a structural feature (attribute or association) is irrelevant for the domain or the applications, instead of setting a lower limit of multiplicity to 0, simply remove it from the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. However, in the UML models representing Application Profiles, special attention shall be given to the multiplicity, reducing variation in the instance data to a minimum. And if a property (attribute or connector) is mandatory in the data, then its minimum cardinality shall be set to 1, for example [1..*] [epo-cmc, sec 4.5]. A good practice is to always indicate cardinality. It may be left unspecified, but this is not recommended. When in doubt, it is recommended to fall back on the implicit assumption of [0..*]. Not to be confused with the default cardinality assumed in tools. For example, Enterprise Architect by default assumes [1..1] cardinality for attributes and omits to display it; and a similar default assumption exists in XML/XSD. Notation for multiple cardinality can be either with * or n. In principle using either notation is fine, however, it is recommended to use only one of those notations within a given data specification consistently, if possible, to enhance readability. It is worth highlighting this, as some UML tools, by default, might use a different notation for multiple cardinality depending on whether it is specifying the cardinality of attributes vs. that of connectors. The UML processing tools should be implemented so as to handle either of those notations, as their meaning is identical. Unless, well explained, no rigid constraints shall be imposed on attributes and associations. In other words, if specified, the cardinality shall be the most permissive, where possible [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Limit the constraints to business rules, do not add technical constraints to the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.16]. If an attribute or an association from a reused vocabulary is irrelevant, do not set the lower limit of multiplicity to 0, but simply omit it in the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Examples: All Core Vocabularies have set a permissive cardinality [0..*], for example, all the properties of Public Organisation, shown with ligh orange background, have multiplicity [0..*], while the same Public Organisation reused in CPSV-AP, shown in blue, has mandatory properties: Title: Connector definition and usage Identifier CMC-R12 Statement: UML Connectors shall be used to define relations and properties taking non-atomic type values. A connector declaration should specify multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: UML Connectors shall be used to denote object properties (see OWL 2 semantics, [owl2]). First, we explain how the connectors ought to be used, i.e., where to specify the relationship names and multiplicity. Then we explain the optional usage of the dependency connector type. On connector names, a generic UML connector may have a name applied to it, and it may have source/target roles specified in addition. This provides flexibility to how the domain knowledge may be expressed in UML; however, this freedom increases the level of ambiguity as well. Therefore, we foresee two distinct ways to express properties: using the connector (generic) name or using the connector source/target ends. We strongly recommend using the source/target role name to indicate the relation name and leave empty the (generic) element name. So, if a target role is specified, then no connector name can be specified. Optionally a source role may be provided to indicate the inverse relation. In this case, the relation direction must be changed from \"Source → Target\" to \"Bidirectional\". Or conversely, if the connector direction is \"Bidirectional\", then source and target roles must be provided. No other directions are permitted. It is recommended that each association has a definition. The definition is then used for each role as they represent the same meaning manifested in the inverse direction. Alternatively, definitions can be specified along the target and source roles. UML defines multiple types of connectors. We recommend relying mainly on the UML Association connector type. Optionally a UML Dependency Connector type may be used if the meaning and usage conditions are well-defined. The UML Association connectors represent relations between a source and a target classes. The association connector cannot be used between other kinds of UML Elements. The UML Dependency connector may be used between a UML Class and UML Enumeration boxes, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It indicates the class has an owl:ObjectProperty, whose range is a controlled vocabulary [CMC-R14]. The connector must have the direction \"Source → Target\". No other directions are acceptable. The UML Generalization connector signifies a class-subClass relation and is transformed into rdfs:subClassOf relation standing between a source and target classes. The connector must have no name or source/target roles specified in the UML model. If a model class should inherit a class from an external model, then proxies must be created for those classes [GC-R1, Reuse of a class with semantic adaptation]. For example, if Person specialises a foaf:Agent. Title: All elements are \"public\" Identifier CMC-R13 Statement: The visibility of all UML Elements should be \"public\". Description: For semantic data specifications, accessibility to the information is not a concern. The sole concern is to specify the semantics of the information as precisely as possible. Therefore, the UML access or privacy annotations shall not be interpreted, and the \"+\" symbol shall always be used next to each property. This symbol means \"public\" [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.22]. Examples: The Person class in Core Vocabulary Person only has public properties indicated with a \"+\" symbol next to each property. Title: Controlled lists as Enumerations Identifier CMC-R14 Statement: The controlled lists of values shall be referred to as UML Enumerations and specified whenever possible. Description: References to controlled lists shall be done via UML Enumeration elements. Content and lifecycle management of controlled lists shall be separated from the management of the semantic data specification. Controlled lists play an essential role in establishing interoperability standards. Management and publication of controlled lists are not part of this style guide. The expectation is that the controlled lists are published in accordance with best practices and represented with the SKOS model using persistent identifiers. In such an approach, the controlled list is expressed as a skos:ConceptScheme and the specific values as skos:Concept(s). Also, such controlled lists are often developed, published and maintained independently following their own lifecycle, so that they can be reused in other models. Two use-cases can be identified in practice: (a) when the code list is known and is explicitly referred to as the range of a property, and (b) when a property is modelled but no code list reference is provided as its range. When the authors of a conceptual model intend to omit which controlled list shall be used, then a class attribute with the range skos:Concept (in some cases Code is preferred) can be created to indicate that. This approach can be useful in situations when multiple (external) controlled lists can be used interchangeably. For example, the adms:status property of a dcat:CatalogueRecord shall be a skos:Concept, without specifying the controlled list. It is advisable, however, to be specific concerning which controlled list shall be used. In such cases, an Enumeration shall be created representing the controlled list. The Enumeration shall be empty, i.e., not specifying any value, because the values are assumed to be maintained externally and only the reference is necessary. The properties having this controlled list as range shall be depicted as UML connectors (dependencies or associations) between a Class and an Enumeration [CMC-R2]. For example, in ePO, dct:Location can have a country code represented as a dependency relation to at-voc:country (the country authority table published on the EU Vocabularies website). The name of the Enumeration shall be resolved to a URI identical to that of the skos:ConceptScheme. As for the connector type we recommend using a dependency connector (depicted with a dashed line) because the semantic interpretation differs slightly from the association connector (depicted with a continuous line). Namely, the range of the property has to fulfil two constraints: (a) instantiating the skos:Concept class and (b) being skos:inScheme the intended controlled list [epo-arch]. If the controlled list is specific to the model then the author shall define the values of the UML Enumeration inside of it, which are interpreted as concepts belonging to the containing concept scheme [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.17]. Examples: The COFOG controlled list is suggested in Core Public Organisation to describe the purpose of an Organisation (as depicted in the image on top) while in CPSV-AP, the same COFOG list is used to indicate the functions of government which a public service is intended for (as depicted in the image below). While the COFOG controlled list is owned by the UN and maintained by the Publications Office in the form of SKOS concept schemes, it can be reused by the Core Public Organisation and CPSV-AP independently. Title: Partition the model into packages Identifier CMC-R15 Statement: Packages have no semantic value, but shall be used whenever possible to logically organise the model. Description: It is highly recommended to avoid defining any semantic interpretation into UML Packages, as they are best used for organisational purposes, defining logical partitions in the model. Therefore, packages can serve as a method of slicing the conceptual model into subdomains. It is also possible to use packages as namespace indicators. Although it works well for classes, it fails to cover the needs for managing namespaces of connectors and attributes. Moreover, it does not work in cases when an attribute, or a connector is used multiple times in several packages. Hence, namespace management is easier attained by using other methods such as using prefixes in Element names or using Element tags [epo-cmc, sec 4.3]. Examples: In the image below, each class is organised in a package mapped to a namespace. However, for convenience, Core Vocabularies are in multiple packages but mapped to the same namespace. Title: Diagram readability Identifier CMC-R16 Statement: UML class diagrams shall be organised for readability. Description: UML class diagrams are used for depicting the conceptual model. Their primary purpose is to construe the meaning of concepts, relations and their organisation to the human reader. Therefore, the diagrams shall be optimised for readability. We recommend that the diagrams: are well spaced (proper space between lines, boxes and labels) minimise the number of crossing connectors prefer orthogonal to straight connectors align elements horizontally & vertically space elements evenly avoid overlapping labels and depict all labels align labels horizontally and avoid vertical or oblique alignment place subclasses under or to the right of their parent place the part under or to the right of the whole at aggregates or composites . minimise the number of details are short and concise (multiple small(-er) diagrams are preferred to one large diagram) diagram size: prefer multiple themed small(er) diagrams to large and crowded ones diagrams shall not be bigger than one A4 page simplify complex diagrams: by breaking it down into several smaller diagrams by highlighting certain parts of the diagram by hiding attributes, role names, etc. that are not relevant symbol size: symbols should be equal nothing shall draw more attention unless intended elements of equal importance should be equally large inherited attributes of a superclass shall be visible if the superclass is not in the diagram See also [ oslo-rules, semic-sgdraft ] Examples: In the example below, taken from Core Person, the classes are aligned vertically and horizontally, subclasses are placed just below the related parent class, the relations are horizontal, vertical, or orthogonal. Title: Element stereotypes Identifier CMC-R17 Statement: Stereotypes do not have semantic or normative value. They shall be avoided in the conceptual models unless a good motivation, and a strong need is provided. Description: We strongly encourage semantic practitioners to avoid stereotypes of any normative or semantic value. One common usage of stereotypes is to provide deontic indicators. See [GC-7 on Deontic modals] where we explain why their use is discouraged and what can be done instead. There is a practice to mark some classes as \"abstract\" with the intention of preventing those from being instantiated. This is also a technical level constraint and does not belong in the semantic layer. We acknowledge that stereotypes can be useful for editorial and dissemination purposes; to indicate a classification or grouping of a specific sort. Stereotypes can be used to support concerns specific to an implementation of the transformation toolchain. See the examples below. Examples: Stereotypes can be used to indicate what content goes into various output file during the transformation process. Stereotypes can be used to visually group the class attributes. When applied on the relations (UMl connectors) stereotypes have the opposite effect: that of cluttering and decrease the diagram readability. Title: Datatype definition and usage Identifier CMC-R18 Statement: We strongly recommend that only OWL 2 compliant datatypes are used. The creation of custom datatypes shall be avoided. Description: Similar to [epo-cmc, sec 4.7], this convention draws the distinction between primitive (or atomic) types (consisting of single literal value) and composite types (consisting of multiple attributes) (see also [cv-handbook, sec 3.1]). In fact, the composite datatypes must be defined as classes and handled as such. For example, Amount, Identifier, Quantity and Measurement are to be treated as classes, even if conceptually they could be seen as composite datatypes. It is recommended to employ the primitive datatypes that are already defined in XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf], in particular a subset of those that is OWL 2 compliant. This should cover the standard, and most common types. Thus, definitions of custom datatypes shall be avoided unless the model really needs them. Such cases are, however, rare. The reason for avoiding complex datatypes, is that once we start structuring how data shall be organised, besides syntactic definitions, we inevitably embed semantic aspects as well. Doing so, the semantics of the structure is obscured and trapped in a technical interoperability layer. For example, xsd:duration encodes both the amount(s) and unit(s) of time into a regular expression that looks like this P5Y2M10D. The definition of datatypes in the UML model should be also avoided, even in cases where a toolchain performing the transformation of UML can automatically resolve those into their XSD equivalent using a correspondence table, such as the one presented below. Note that from the family of string datatypes we recommend using the following ones (in this order of preference): rdf:PlainLiteral, rdfs:Literal, xsd:string, and rdf:langString. Often enabling multilingual data specification is a necessity. UML XSD Boolean xsd:boolean Float xsd:float Integer xsd:integer Character, String xsd:string / rdf:langString Short xsd:short Long xsd:long Decimal xsd:decimal Date xsd:date DateTime xsd:dateTime xsd:anyURI Code see CMC-R14 We strongly recommended the use of OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF standard datatypes, if possible. They might be useful also for indicating a specific datatype, which is not possible with the UML ones. For example, making a distinction between a general string (xsd:string) and a literal with a language tag (rdf:langString), or XML encoded ones such as rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral.

Description: There are various languages allowing for data shape expression and thus define validation rules for RDF data. Among the executable ones, the most well-known are SHACL [shacl] and ShEx [shex]. We are aware that a strong community of practice exists for ShEx. However, as SHACL is a W3C standard, we strongly recommend using it. Title: Loose versus rigid constraints Identifier DSC-R2 Statement: In a Core Vocabulary, then the data shape constraints shall be as loose as possible, i.e., permissive, while in an Application Profile, the data shape constraints shall be as rigid as necessary, i.e. restrictive. Description: The Core Vocabularies are intended for a broad reuse and are concerned with establishing the concepts. This is addressed by the ontology artefact. Optionally it may be accompanied by a minimal set of data shape constraints expressing general domain limitations. For example, it may be already defined in the Core Vocabulary that a class cannot be instantiated without certain mandatory properties or that a declared property shall be used only with values from a pre-established controlled vocabulary. If a data shape artefact is provided, then any Application Profile reusing the Core Vocabulary shall not only import the ontology, but the data shapes as well. The Application Profiles are usually intended for narrower use cases and mostly are concerned with setting restrictions on the way reused vocabulary ought to be used. It is a good practice to make such restrictions as restrictive as necessary but still provide space for variation as it typically occurs in practice. This is even more important when an Application Profile is conceived as reusable in other Application Profiles. Examples: Consider DCAT-AP, for example. It is an Application Profile on top of the DCAT vocabulary, but other more specific Application Profiles are still created on top of it (e.g., DCAT-AP CH, DCAT-AP DE, DCAT-AP NO, etc.) Title: Open and Closed world assumptions Identifier DSC-R3 Statement: The data instantiating a core model may be fragmented across information systems. For representation purposes, open-world assumptions shall be adopted, and for validation purposes, a closed-world assumption shall be adopted. Description: Operations on the data, such as automated reasoning and validation, are impacted by what is assumed about its completeness. If it is considered complete, then we say that we operate under the closed-world assumption; otherwise, in the cases of continually evolving and distributed data (that is more in line with reality), the data is considered possibly incomplete, and we say that operating is under the open-world assumption. Under the closed-world assumption, it is presumed that a true statement is also known to be true. Therefore, conversely, what is not currently known to be true, is false [reiter81]. The opposite of the closed-world assumption is the open-world assumption stating that lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. The truth value of a statement may be true despite whether or not it is known to be true. This means that when validating, the data must be considered complete to assess whether it fulfils the imposed constraints or recommended shapes. Therefore, everything that is not known to be true must be considered false. This may have an impact, especially for larger vocabularies (such as the eProcurement ontology), on how the data shapes are organised. As data shapes may be used to suggest how the data may be fragmented and how it shall not. Title: Shape definitions Identifier DSC-R4 Statement: Each ontology class shall be mirrored by a sh:NodeShape. The property constraints may be embedded (contextualised) within node shapes or defined as freestanding. Description: When generating SHACL shapes, it is a good practice to create a node shape for each class in the Conceptual Model and, within it, a property shape for each property of that class. If the property shapes are defined within the node shapes (rather than freestanding), then we mirror the structure depicted in the Conceptual Model. Doing so is intuitive for the readers, the resulting constraint definitions are organically integrated, and the maintenance costs are decreased. However, sometimes it may be useful to define the property shapes as freestanding, therefore making them reusable independent of the node shape context. Freestanding property shapes are universal constraints on the property. They apply to all usages, in all possible data exchanges. Therefore, their use should be limited to those cases that support the broadest reuse context, and do not encode a specific application usage context. As such, freestanding property shapes play more a role in the validation of the correct usage of the property in an application context, rather than in the correct data exchange. The above considerations do not exclude that property shapes used within a node shape could be named with a unique URI, through the reuse of which a coherent network of constraints can be facilitated. The shapes shall be created in a separate namespace in order to allow dereferencing to either OWL 2 or SHACL definitions. In some communities, the URIs used in the OWL 2 specifications are reused in SHACL. The class definitions are extended as node shapes. In SHACL semantics, this is interpreted as an equivalent to specifying a sh:targetNode class. This approach allows the use of a single reference in both the ontology and data shape definition yet specifies separate concerns in separate artefacts. The advantage of the approach is increased consistency and readability while maintenance costs decrease. Yet, this approach does not allow for dereferencing separately OWL 2 or SHACL representations. Hence, it is recommended to avoid such practice. Title: Data shape severity Identifier DSC-R5 Statement: It is recommended to use constraint severity for distinguishing critical violations from non-critical recommendation warnings and from nice-to-have information. Description: Data shapes can be assigned a level of severity. The specific values of severity have no impact on the validation but may be used by user interface tools to categorise validation results. The severity levels are: Info - A non-critical constraint violation indicating an informative message. Warning - A non-critical constraint violation indicating a warning. Violation - A constraint violation.","title":"Data shape conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"gc-data-shape-conventions","url":"/style-guide/develop/gc-data-shape-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Data shape language choice","hash":"sec:dsc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Loose versus rigid constraints","hash":"sec:dsc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Open and Closed world assumptions","hash":"sec:dsc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Shape definitions","hash":"sec:dsc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Data shape severity","hash":"sec:dsc-r5","id":5}]},"48":{"id":48,"text":"Title: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible Identifier GC-R1 Statement: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible, respecting the original semantics and lexicalisation. Description: Only use constructs with semantics (human and machine-readable) that support the use case or domain. A similar reflex must be considered by reusing properties and classes from other vocabularies. As a general rule, it is safe to reuse annotation properties, as they carry no logical semantics. Conversely, no concepts shall be redefined unless they are significant variations of the existent ones. In order to achieve a common approach to reuse, apply the reuse guidelines as specified above [Clarification on the reuse]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Prefer maintained vocabularies Identifier GC-R2 Statement: Quality of maintenance and governance should be reviewed before reuse. Reuse mostly vocabularies that are well maintained and governed. Description: Some projects are implemented and closed, while some other ones keep being maintained. The maintenance usually aims at (a) fixing errors, (b) making gradual improvements, and (c) supporting users in using the released data specification, to mention the least. Maintenance of the project can also include URI dereferencing and handling open issues in a timely fashion. Some projects may foresee an evolution roadmap, defined in a change and release policy, with a series of evolution stages planned. Title: Concept reference and terms Identifier GC-R3 Statement: Each concept shall be (a) referenceable by a URI, (b) formally defined and (c) described by a precise, unambiguous human-readable label and definition. Description: Terms and concepts are not the same things. A term is a word, compound word, or multi-word expression that, in specific contexts, is given specific meanings – these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well-named (termed) by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. So, we need a precise way to refer to concepts. The mechanism offering such a possibility is using URIs to establish the identity of a concept’s \"meaning\". URIs also enable referencing, an essential feature of meaning exchange (communication). Such a reference allows for establishing a common meaning, not only between humans and machines but also among humans. Finally, the meaning of the term must be clear. Its definition is associated with the term via the URI. To make the term reusable, it should be published as part of a data specification. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Vocabulary terminology style Identifier GC-R4 Statement: The terminology style shall be consistent across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, some variation in terminology style (concept naming conventions) can be noticed across a wide range of semantic data specifications. Whatever the adopted style may be, the author shall consistently apply it to the whole model. These names will be reflected in all artefacts and in the URIs. Next, we provide a set of loose recommendations: British English is the lingua franca in the model. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations in concept names Classes are names with nouns and singular Names are case-sensitive. Relations and Properties use verbs at a present tense Some practices suggest adding the prefix \"has\" for quality attributes like \"weight\", \"height\", etc. or the prefix or \"is\" for boolean indicators, and some other practices recommend avoiding such prefixes as they add no additional information to the name. Most often, the name of the inverse relation should not be a semantically inverted verb, such as in the case of \"buys/sells\" or \"opens/closes\". It should be done by changing the voice from active to passive, e.g. \"plays/playedBy\". Title: Vocabulary definition styling Identifier GC-R5 Statement: The concept definitions shall be elaborated consistently across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, different styles of defining concepts can be noticed across a range of semantic data specifications. The SEMIC Principles for creating good definitions [semic-defs] are a basis for writing definitions. They are based on advice found in the literature and are the following: Be concise but complete, Avoid over-generalisations. Adapt and contextualise the definition to the surrounding/connected concepts. Make sure that every concept that occurs in the model is directly (or indirectly) defined Describe only one term Structure the definition in a standardised way: Use the singular form to phrase the definition [GC-R4] State what the term is, and don’t enumerate what it is NOT (no negative definition) Use only commonly understood abbreviations Use similar terminology for related definitions Don’t use circular definitions, i.e. the term defined should not be part of the definition, Don’t add secondary information such as additional explanation, scoping, examples, etc. these are to be documented in usage notes. Form the definition in one or more sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a period. Do not start a definition with a repetition of the name of the concept. Rich standard encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 are supported in notes and definitions. In the element names, however, we recommend avoiding any character encodings and using plain ASCII [epo-cmc, sec 4.2]. Title: Reuse compliance Identifier GC-R6 Statement: Compliance with a semantic data specification is satisfied by appropriate usage of terms that is in accordance with definitions and constraints. Compliance checking with an application semantic data specification shall be permissive. This means that what is not forbidden is permitted. If the context requires more restrictions,then an application profile needs to be established for a narrow(er) scenario. Technically, we envisage compliance checking limited to correct referencing of the concept URIs and respecting the cardinality constraints and value constraints in the case of properties. This falls within the scope of data shape definitions. Additionally, more specific compliance requirements and constraints can be added as necessary. Compliance checking may involve multiple levels of severity. For example in the SHACL specifications three levels are defined: Violation, Warning, Info. We assume by default the SHACL severity specifications unless other denotations systems are provided (i.e. different labels and delimitation of severity). Also in absense of specifications, any unfulfilled compliance check is considered a Violation. The semantic data specifications may provide such severity levels. How it is realised in the conceptual model is open at the moment. The main place to provide such specifications is the data shape artefact. In the future we can return to this aspect and provide more guidance. Title: Deontic modals Identifier GC-R7 Statement: Indicators of deontic modalities for classes and properties do not have semantic or normative value. Still they may be used as editorial annotations. Deontic modalities indicate levels obligation, permission, necessity and related concepts. As a general recommendation, to use deontic indicators in the semantic data specifications is discouraged. Such indicators could be of editorial or guiding role for the users and adopters of the data specifications. However, it should be noted that they are not considered as part of any compliance validation or semantic interpretation of the data model. In the standardisation community a common practice is to indicate levels of obligation or permission for concepts in a semantic data specification. Obligation indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is required in an instantiation; while, Permission indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is allowed or forbidden in an instantiation. The common deontic indicator values are: mandatory signifying that a statement using a class or property is required, recommended signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional but recommended, optional signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional, forbidden signifying that a statement using a class or property is not permitted. Still, there are ways to achieve the same effect as the these indicators through other means. For properties, the main instrument is employment of cardinality constraints (per property per class). To make a property mandatory set the minimum cardinality to one or more [1..*], otherwise relax the minimum cardinality constraint to keep the property optional [0..*]. For classes, it is possible to mark a class as abstract, which means that it cannot be directly instantiated, therefore achieving the effect of forbidden. However, deontic indicators shall be avoided for classes because a class may be mandatory and optional in different instantiation or exchange scenarios within the same application profile. For example consider the DCAT-AP and two mandatory classes: dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset. When metadata of a catalogue (and its records) is exchanged, then both classes dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset must be instantiated; however when a single dataset metadata is being exchange then only dcat:Dataset instance shall be provided. Moreover, in the second scenario, providing an instance of dcat:Catalog will be counterproductive and possible leading to errors. Descriptions of what classes can or shall be bundled together when participating in information exchange belong in \"data exchange contracts\", \"API endpoint scheme definitions\" or the likes of these. Such specifications belong in the Technical Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif], and are (currently) out of scope of this style guide, which aims primarily at addressing the semantic interoperability. If semantic engineers prefer or are compelled to employ deontic indicators, then deontic indicators must be precisely defined and those definitions must be published. No reliance on common sense understanding shall be assumed as the meaning of such deontic indicators may (and certainly) differ not only among readers of data specifications but also in different data specifications.","title":"General conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"gc-general-conventions","url":"/style-guide/develop/gc-general-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Reuse existing concepts as much as possible","hash":"sec:gc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Prefer maintained vocabularies","hash":"sec:gc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Concept reference and terms","hash":"sec:gc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Vocabulary terminology style","hash":"sec:gc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Vocabulary definition styling","hash":"sec:gc-r5","id":5},{"text":"Reuse compliance","hash":"sec:gc-r6","id":6},{"text":"Deontic modals","hash":"sec:gc-r7","id":7}]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"Title: Follow a methodology Identifier MC-R1 Statement: It is strongly recommended that a clear, explicit methodology is adopted for the content development and lifecycle management of a semantic data specification. Conversely, no data specification shall be developed and managed without following a clear methodology. Description: A methodology is a set of methods, processes, and practices that are repeatedly carried out to deliver projects (TOGAF [togaf]). It helps by using a clear set of processes for managing projects that everyone in the organisation understands, reducing risks, and improving the chances of success. A good methodology that fits the context and environment of an organisation can provide clear guidance on what, who, when, and how a project should be done. It also provides a clear path and a systematic strategy to solve the in-field problems. We do not outline a concrete methodology here but merely point to the benefits of adopting and using one. In the SEMIC context, conceptual model development will benefit greatly from embracing some or a combination of techniques and frameworks in data modelling (e.g. Bottom-Up, Top-Down, Case-Based, Entity-Relationship, Object-Oriented, Star/Snowflake Schema data modelling techniques, etc.), ontology engineering methodologies (e.g. Methontology [fernandez-lopez97], DOGMA [jarrar08], OntoClean [guarino04], TOVE [fox92], DILIGENT [pinto04], NeOn [neon], etc. [sure09]), data management body of knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK [dama-dmbok]) or architecture frameworks and practices (e.g. TOGAF [togaf], Zachman Framework [zachman87], EAP [spewak06], etc.). Among other benefits of adopting a clear and well-defined methodology are: Clear lifecycle management Connection between model and expressed (business) requirements Implementation consistency Proper business requirements management (specifications, use cases, scenarios, competency questions, etc. are collected, edited, maintained, referred by the concepts) Title: Scope and goals definition Identifier MC-R2 Statement: A semantic data specification shall have clear goals and a well-established scope definition. Description: Establishing project scope ensures that the modelling work is focused and executed to expectations. It also helps define where the boundary of the model is and what shall be left out. The clearer the scope the higher chances of success are. It shall be possible to determine the scope of a data specification from the use cases for which it is drawn up. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.4] Title: Modularisation Identifier MC-R3 Statement: If a domain contains a lot of concepts that have to be modelled, then it is recommended to partition it into subdomains and manage them as connected modules. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] Description: Divide and conquer method works in many situations, including in the modelling realm. It may not be easy, however, to make a clearcut separation between concepts belonging to one module or another, and such an attempt will certainly bring clarity. Sometimes, a concept can be used for several domains. Then it shall be placed in a separate module. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] The need for modularisation typically emerges when the to-be-modelled space grows. As the terms are to be identified by URIs [PC-R2], it is recommended to include in the used URI structure modularisation potential. Examples: For example, in the eProcurement ontology(ePO) [epo], there is a core ontology and there are extension modules such as eCatalogue, eOrdering, and eNotice [epo] that further refine and extend a specific part of the core. For example, Core Location is used across other Core Vocabularies and is established as a CV on its own.","title":"Methodology conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"gc-methodology-conventions","url":"/style-guide/develop/gc-methodology-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Follow a methodology","hash":"sec:mc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Scope and goals definition","hash":"sec:mc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Modularisation","hash":"sec:mc-r3","id":3}]},"50":{"id":50,"text":"Title: 5-star Linked Open Data Identifier PC-R1 Statement: Publishing data specifications shall be compliant with 5-star LOD criteria. Description: Publishing a vocabulary as a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource means making it accessible, both human and machine-readable, in a standard way, thus supporting the semantic web. The publication as full LOD implies that the data is compliant with the highest grade of 5-Star [5star-od] open data evaluation: The data is available on the Web under an open licence The data is available following a clear structure The data is available using a non-proprietary open format The data uses URIs to denote concepts The data is linked to other resources to provide context On the same note, the FAIR Data Principles [fair-principles] is a more comprehensive and rich set of guidelines for publishing data on the web. They ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data, as a result of the increase in volume, complexity and creation speed of data [fair-guidelines]. See more [ dwbp, ld-bp, ldp-bp ] Title: Persistent URI policy Identifier PC-R2 Statement: The URIs that are used to identify the terms modelled in the data specifications should be dereferenceable Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] and comply with a URI policy (or URI strategy). URIs that are well-defined according to such criteria are often denoted as PURIs [10rules-puri]. SEMIC adheres to the EU persistent URI policy. Each SEMIC URI is dereferenceable in both machine representation (RDF artefacts) and human-readable (HTML artefact). Description: When publishing data on the web [dwdp], it is crucial to have a structured and persistent system of URIs in place. Such URIs make it easy for the users to understand the vocabulary structure and retrieve information as they expect. The 10 rules for Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] are base principles for the design of quality identifiers. Regarding URI design, the main consideration of creators should be that when a URI is created, all its parts should be resistant to change. For instance, locations and organisation names can change and therefore should not be used in URIs. First and foremost, when introducing semantics in URIs, the strings used need to reflect what the resources are (i.e. intrinsic characteristics such as the type or nature), not who owns them or where they are [uri-dp]. In 2014, the ISA Programme devised a common policy for managing persistent HTTP-based URIs of EU institutions [uri-dp, 10rules-puri, puri-gov-eu]. That has led to an EU wide URI resolution service, prescribing that each URI is of the following pattern: http://data.europa.eu/{Collection}/{Reference} The {Collection} is an organisation-agnostic name for a collection of terms. Within a {Collection} the local names, or references, are being maintained according to the policy of the {Collection}. For SEMIC data specifications, the names are dependent on the naming conventions mentioned in this style guide rules [GC-R4 + CMC-R3]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, ] Examples: For example, the PURIs defined within the SEMIC Core Vocabularies are all within the {Collection} m8g. And thus the term Evidence in the context of CCCEV is denoted with the PURI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/Evidence. Title: Version management Identifier PC-R3 Statement: A consistent version management shall be implemented for the data specification evolution respecting the \"semantic versioning\" principles. Description: The SEMIC versioning methodology is based on \"semantic versioning\" principles [sem-ver] and implements a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. It involves describing clearly and precisely what is being published and which features are included, and what the limitations are, setting the expectations and scope. Once the artefacts are identified for the public, the changes to the data specifications are communicated with specific increments to the version number and with associated change notes. The version format is X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). As a rule of thumb, bug fixes do not affect the artefact and increment the Patch version. Backwards compatible artefact additions/changes increment the Minor version. And, backwards-incompatible artefact changes increment the Major version. Examples: For example, evolving from version 1.3.5 to 1.3.6 represents a backwards-compatible patch, from 1.3.5 to 1.4.0, a backwards-compatible new development, while switching from 1.3.5 to 2.0.0 breaks the backwards compatibility. Title: Artefact versioning Identifier PC-R4 Statement: The data specification shall be versioned as a whole and never to atomic elements (concepts, relations or constraints). Description: Create a new version with each publication. Using the semantic version principles to determine the exact version number depends on whether it is a major, minor or patch update. The version shall be assigned to the entire vocabulary or Application Profile and never to elements in the model (concepts, relations, constraints, etc.) [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.6]. The version shall be saved as the model metadata (for example, in the owl:Ontology header). No version information shall be embedded into any artefact URIs unless it is a version URI provided via owl:versionIRI. Title: URI dereferencing Identifier PC-R5 Statement: Any URI identifiable resource devised in a data specification shall be dereferenceable. Description: Dereferencing means that one can use the URI as an URL to retrieve related information back. The format and representation in which the information is returned depend on content negotiation. Content negotiation is the interaction between the client application and the server in which the client informs the server about its preferred format and representation and the server responds with the best-fitting result it can provide. It is recommended to provide (format) content negotiation for HTTP which is based on the interpretation of the Accept: HTTP header. The dereferencing shall be provided for both human-readable and machine-readable formats. A human-aimed HTML representation is the default response (if no content type is specified), and the other is RDF [10rules-puri]. Because the HTML representation is usally a long document, which makes it hard to find the information about a specific term, it is recommended that the HTML representation has landing points based on the used fragment identifier. Dereferencing can then route the reader to the most relevant information within the HTML document. For other representations/formats no additional requirements are imposed. For example, the dereferencing in the RDF representation, depends on the implemented recipe, i.e. based on # or /; and it may return either the corresponding fragment or the whole RDF document [pub-recipe]. Further technical details can be found in \"Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies\" [rdf-pub]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp ] Title: Human-readable form Identifier PC-R6 Statement: Each data specification shall have a corresponding human-readable form representing the model documentation. Description: The documentation content shall follow a standard template for consistent formatting and content structuring. It is a good practice to provide the following sections in the document: Preamble with metadata indicating Title Abstract Date of publication/release Version information Authors, editors, contributors Licensing information Introduction describing the Background information Context & Scope Intended audience UML diagrams of the model Description of each element in the model grouped by element type (e.g. class, property, constraint, controlled vocabulary). Each element shall be described by its URI and its Lexicalisation: URI (shall be clearly visible) Labels (preferred and alternative) Definitions, scope notes, examples, editorial notes, etc. Moreover, consider following the good practices for documenting OWL 2 and SHACL artefacts, and include the appropriate details in the data specification documentation. For OWL 2, we can mention tools like Widoco [widoco] and LODE [lode]; and for SHACL, follow the SHACL recommendation [shacl], or the metadata support implemented in tools such as SHACL-play [shacl-play]. For application profiles, consider aligning to the DCAP [dcap], which is an implementation agnostic recommendation.","title":"Publication conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"gc-publication-conventions","url":"/style-guide/develop/gc-publication-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"5-star Linked Open Data","hash":"sec:pc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Persistent URI policy","hash":"sec:pc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Version management","hash":"sec:pc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Artefact versioning","hash":"sec:pc-r4","id":4},{"text":"URI dereferencing","hash":"sec:pc-r5","id":5},{"text":"Human-readable form","hash":"sec:pc-r6","id":6}]},"51":{"id":51,"text":"Title: Formal language choice Identifier SC-R1 Statement: The formal ontology shall be expressed in OWL 2. Description: In the Semantic Web domain, two formal languages can be used for expressing the ontology: RDFS [rdfs] and OWL 2 [owl2]. RDFS is simpler and only allows for some of the recommended expressions (for example, the distinction between datatype and object properties is not possible). OWL 2 is more complex and more expressive than RDFS. We recommend using only a limited set of expression types available in OWL 2 language [SC-R2]. Examples: Core Vocabularies have an RDF representation as OWL 2 Ontology. In the example below, part of Core Person is depicted: @prefix dc: . @prefix foaf: . @prefix owl: . @prefix rdf: . @prefix rdfs: . @prefix schemas: . @prefix xsd: . a rdfs:Class; rdfs:label \"Person\"@en . a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; dc:mediator [ foaf:homepage ; foaf:name \"Semantic Interoperability Community (SEMIC)\" ]. Title: Limited (OWL 2) expressivity Identifier SC-R2 Statement: The formal ontology shall be lightweight in its logical underpinning, focusing mainly on the concept declarations, generalisation axioms and annotations. Description: OWL 2 language provides a high level of expressivity. In the SEMIC interoperability context, the primary purpose of semantic artefacts is to establish the common set of concepts and how they are employed in data exchange. For this purpose, simple OWL 2 constructs suffice. Therefore, the OWL 2 ontology shall be kept lightweight, and no advanced logical definitions are necessary, which would make the ontology heavyweight. The Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, dedicated an entire section on the charm of weak semantics in the linked data world. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. We recommend the formal ontology definition be limited to the following types of expressions: class declarations (owl:Class, rdfs:Class) data property declarations (owl:DatatypeProperty, rdf:Property) object property declarations (owl:ObjectProperty, rdf:Property) subclass relations (rdfs:subClassOf) subproperty relations (rdfs:subPropertyOf) annotations concept labels (rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel, skos:altLabel) concept definitions (rdfs:comment, skos:definition, skos:scopeNote) notes and comments (rdfs:comment, skos:editorialNote, skos:changeNote, skos:historyNote, skos:example) ontology header with import statements (owl:import) version metadata (owl:versionInfo, owl:versionIRI) provenance metadata (e.g. dct:issued, adms:status) descriptive metadata The formal ontology shall not include other types of statements unless justified as necessary. The properties used, in particular those related to the ontology header, shall be aligned with the governance process. No expressions of (a) property domain specification (rdfs:domain) and (b) property range specification (rdfs:range) shall be used unless justified as absolutely necessary. The need for setting property domain and range constraints is better fulfilled by the data shapes expressed in SHACL language. Keeping the ontology lightweight allows the maximum freedom for reuse (e.g. in different application profiles, where domains/ranges can be specified or restricted), and does not interfere with the validation concerns covered by the data shapes. Note: This recommendation does not prevent the generation of more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity), as additional artefacts that would be included in the data specification. A data specification could even provide several such ontology versions, one for each OWL 2 profiles (EL/QL/RL), for example, if there are well-defined use cases identified for them. However, if such additional ontologies will be provided as part of the data specification, it is essential that they are all be kept consistent with all the other artefacts (including the lightweight ontology, the human-readable version, etc.) (see section on Transformation). Therefore, it is highly recommended having appropriate tool support, which enables the automatic generation of all the ontologies that are needed from the conceptual model. Regardless of how many ontology versions will be generated and published as part of the data specification, the most important thing, and hence the main point of this recommendation, is that there should always be at least one lightweight ontology, to support a highest level of interoperability and reuse. Often, this is called the \"core\" ontology, in data specifications that provide multiple ontology versions, while the other, more expressive, ontology versions have different names. Examples: For example, consider the (shortened) DCAT-AP imports header: rdf:type owl:Ontology ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports . Or consider, the (shortened) Core Person vocabulary header: a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; Title: Lexicalisation Identifier SC-R3 Statement: The choice in handling the lexicalisation of concepts shall be clearly defined and consistently implemented. Description: The lexicalisation of concepts in semantic artefacts can be implemented in multiple ways. Two popular approaches are used in practice: RDFS or SKOS lexicalisation. However, other types can be considered as well (e.g. [lemon], [vann], etc.). RDFS allows for a simple lexicalisation and annotation: labels rdfs:label may be used to provide a human-readable version of a resource’s name. comments rdfs:comment may be used to provide a human-readable description of a resource. SKOS offers a richer and more elaborate lexicalisation and annotation: Lexical labels skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel are useful when generating or creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organisation system. These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS concept. skos:hiddenLabel has a more technical nature and may be useful when a user is interacting with a knowledge organisation system via a text-based search function. The user may, for example, enter misspelled words when trying to find a relevant concept. Documentation properties skos:definition supplies a complete explanation of the intended meaning of a concept; skos:scopeNote supplies some, possibly partial, information about the intended meaning of a concept, especially as an indication of how the use of a concept is limited in indexing practice; skos:note useful for general documentation purposes; skos:example supplies an example of the use of a concept; skos:historyNote describes significant changes to the meaning or the form of a concept; skos:changeNote documents fine-grained changes to a concept, for the purposes of administration and maintenance; skos:editorialNote supplies information that is an aid to administrative housekeeping, such as reminders of editorial work still to be done, or warnings in the event that future editorial changes might be made. We recommend one, or the other is used. Both can be used at the same time without any consequence of semantics, but this will introduce redundancy and possibly a maintenance burden. Examples: For example, in Core Person Vocabulary RDFS lexicalisation is used: a rdf:Property; rdfs:label \"date of birth\"@en . For example in ePO, both lexicalisations are provided (even if this may be considered redundant): :Term a owl:Class ; rdfs:label \"Term\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; rdfs:isDefinedBy ; skos:definition \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; skos:prefLabel \"Term\"@en . Title: Reasoning assumption Identifier SC-R4 Statement: No reasoning capabilities shall be assumed. Description: OWL 2 constructs correspond to Description Logic (DL) concepts (direct semantics). Logic, besides expressing knowledge in a knowledge base, can be used to perform automated reasoning, i.e., inferring new knowledge based on premises and reasoning rules. The inference is also possible with RDF-based semantics, based on translating the axioms into directed graphs. The latter is used for SPARQL entailments and SHACL data shape rules. Automated reasoning is not consistently available across environments: small differences in the usage context or reasoning patterns may lead to different outcomes. Therefore, the editors of interoperable semantic data specifications are strongly recommended to NOT rely on such capabilities. Thus, in practice, the model shall allow for an explicit statement of the intended knowledge, and as little as possible shall be left implicit. Title: Circular definitions Identifier SC-R5 Statement: The data specification (semantic, conceptual, or shape) shall not use circular definitions. Description: Circular definition, i.e., definitions that use the element they define are incorrect. For instance, we say that an ontology element (a class, an object property or a data property) is circular when used in its own definition. This can occur in situations such as the following: (a) the definition of a class as the enumeration of several classes including itself; (b) the appearance of a class within its owl:equivalentClass or rdfs:subClassOf axioms; (c) the appearance of an object property in its rdfs:domain or rdfs:range definitions; or (d) the appearance of a data property in its rdfs:domain definition.","title":"Semantic conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"gc-semantic-conventions","url":"/style-guide/develop/gc-semantic-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Formal language choice","hash":"sec:sc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Limited (OWL 2) expressivity","hash":"sec:sc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Lexicalisation","hash":"sec:sc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Reasoning assumption","hash":"sec:sc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Circular definitions","hash":"sec:sc-r5","id":5}]},"52":{"id":52,"text":"This section provides a series of guidelines and conventions for developing and publishing a Core Vocabulary or an Application Profile.

This style guide may constitute a good source of information and explanations for the European Commission’s officers, collaborating consultants, and stakeholders involved in inter-institutional standardisation. The main purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance and decision-making support for the creators, maintainers and publishers of the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. In the context of European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif] this style guide primarily addresses the Semantic Interoperability layer. The main part of this document is organised as a series of self-contained rules and guidelines. In the scope of this document are included: a terminological clarification for the significant SEMIC terms (including \"reuse\", \"ontology\", \"Core Vocabulary\", etc.); an architecture overview, which interconnects various aspects and data specification types and how they are derived from a single conceptual model; the concept of \"reuse\" in great detail and pinpoints exactly what is permitted and what is not permitted in the SEMIC context; recommendations on organising the conceptual model, the semantic artefacts, and the data shapes; some recommendations on the specification development methodology and some publication conventions. It is considered out of the scope of this document to provide: a complete and specific modelling methodology, a procedure for maintenance and publication, governance (roles, processes, responsibilities, etc.), lifecycle and release management methodology (including the initiation and change requests), any specific implementation instructions, indications as to what set of tools shall be adopted, specifications related to data serialisation, formats or any syntax mapping methods (including syntax binding instructions to for example XSD/XML; or JSON-LD contexts), usage instructions for the end users. This style guide is recommended to be used in combination with complementary documents, among which we consider relevant, but not limited to, the following ones: the user manual of a transformation tool from UML into other representations explaining what transformation rules are supported (i.e. implemented by the tool), the documentation (manuals, handbooks, specifications) of the reused data specifications, the governance and methodology documentation of the organisation developing the new semantic data specification, the adopted URI policy documentation, which can be inter-institutional policy or organisation specific one [10rules-puri]. This document is organised in two parts. The first part provides a brief context description and scope and offers an architectural overview. It introduces important terminological clarifications, the benefits of adopting the separation of concerns principle, and explanations of how it is played out in the SEMIC context. The second part of the document provides a series of guidelines, conventions and assumption specifications. These guidelines are organised according to the aspects they cover. A guideline is a stand-alone description containing an indicative statement and a detailed description providing the rationale, benefits and limitations, implications and practical requirements, and eventually examples. Users who may choose to bypass introductory details may decide to proceed with reading the general guidelines and the ones on the conceptual model first.","title":"Introduction","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"introduction","url":"/style-guide/develop/introduction.html","titles":[{"text":"Target audience","hash":"sec:target-audience","id":1},{"text":"Scope","hash":"sec:scope","id":2},{"text":"How to read this document","hash":"sec:how-to-read","id":3}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"[10rules-puri] Codreanu, D.

References This document defines the style guide to be applied to the SEMIC’s semantic data specifications, notably to the eGovernment Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. It provides rules on naming conventions, syntax, artefact management and organisation. It is meant to be complemented with technical artefacts and implementations that enable automatic conformance checking and transformation of conceptual models into formal semantic representations. The content of these guides is part of the action to promote semantic interoperability amongst the EU Member States, with the objective of fostering the use of standards by, for example, offering guidelines and expert advice on semantic interoperability for public administrations. This style guide is intended primarily for semantic engineers, data architects and knowledge modelling specialists who are acting as editors or reusers of Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. This style guide may constitute a good source of information and explanations for the European Commission’s officers, collaborating consultants, and stakeholders involved in inter-institutional standardisation. The main purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance and decision-making support for the creators, maintainers and publishers of the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. In the context of European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif] this style guide primarily addresses the Semantic Interoperability layer. The main part of this document is organised as a series of self-contained rules and guidelines. In the scope of this document are included: a terminological clarification for the significant SEMIC terms (including \"reuse\", \"ontology\", \"Core Vocabulary\", etc.); an architecture overview, which interconnects various aspects and data specification types and how they are derived from a single conceptual model; the concept of \"reuse\" in great detail and pinpoints exactly what is permitted and what is not permitted in the SEMIC context; recommendations on organising the conceptual model, the semantic artefacts, and the data shapes; some recommendations on the specification development methodology and some publication conventions. It is considered out of the scope of this document to provide: a complete and specific modelling methodology, a procedure for maintenance and publication, governance (roles, processes, responsibilities, etc.), lifecycle and release management methodology (including the initiation and change requests), any specific implementation instructions, indications as to what set of tools shall be adopted, specifications related to data serialisation, formats or any syntax mapping methods (including syntax binding instructions to for example XSD/XML; or JSON-LD contexts), usage instructions for the end users. This style guide is recommended to be used in combination with complementary documents, among which we consider relevant, but not limited to, the following ones: the user manual of a transformation tool from UML into other representations explaining what transformation rules are supported (i.e. implemented by the tool), the documentation (manuals, handbooks, specifications) of the reused data specifications, the governance and methodology documentation of the organisation developing the new semantic data specification, the adopted URI policy documentation, which can be inter-institutional policy or organisation specific one [10rules-puri]. This document is organised in two parts. The first part provides a brief context description and scope and offers an architectural overview. It introduces important terminological clarifications, the benefits of adopting the separation of concerns principle, and explanations of how it is played out in the SEMIC context. The second part of the document provides a series of guidelines, conventions and assumption specifications. These guidelines are organised according to the aspects they cover. A guideline is a stand-alone description containing an indicative statement and a detailed description providing the rationale, benefits and limitations, implications and practical requirements, and eventually examples. Users who may choose to bypass introductory details may decide to proceed with reading the general guidelines and the ones on the conceptual model first. Before detailed definitions and explanations are provided, let’s align on the idea that \"semantic data specifications comprise artefacts\". There are semantic data specifications. They comprise nothing else but a collection of terms, structure and rule specifications on how to combine these terms and (RE)use expectations. In the SEMIC context, a semantic data specification can be either: a Core Vocabulary, or an Application Profile There are Artefacts. They encode or indicate a representation format, attend a need or specific purpose, and address a clear concern. In the SEMIC context, we acknowledge, but not limited to, the following list of artefacts: Persistent URIs OWL 2 representation SHACL representation HTML representation Pictures/Diagrams UML representation JSON-LD representation (+ JSON schema) XML representation (+ XSD schema) …​ Note that not all artefacts are treated in the current style-guide, but only the ones that are in scope of the Semantic Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif]. Definition A conceptual model, also referred to as conceptual model specification, is an abstract representation of a system and comprises well-defined concepts, their qualities or attributes, and their relationships to other concepts. A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. Description A conceptual model is a representation of a system that uses concepts to form said representation. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well named by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. The conceptual model comprises representations of concepts, their qualities or attributes and relationships to other concepts. Most commonly, these are association and generalisation relations. In addition, the conceptual model can be materialised in a graphical representation facilitating knowledge elicitation, organisation and interaction with domain experts. This is relevant because interactions and discussions within a Working Group for a data specification are often driven by a graphical representation. However, the need for a conceptual model and a visual representation shall not be conflated. Thus, we keep clear separation of concerns, which is addressed in detailed in the next section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. There is no perfect candidate for representing the conceptual model. And, although not without limitations, risks for misunderstandings and mis-interpretations, we choose (a subset of) UML language [epo-cm2owl] as most appropriate and instrumental in addressing (a) the concern for having a conceptual model established and (b) the concern for providing a graphical representation. The UML appropriateness has been acknowledged based on a longstanding experience and practices. An entire section of this style guide is dedicated to (UML) conceptual model [see Conceptual model conventions]. The subset of the UML language considered in this style guide is comprised (but not limited to) in the following set of UML elements: Class Class Attribute Connector Association Dependency Generalisation Enumeration For visual representation only UML Class Diagrams are considered. Note: UML will be the recommended language for defining the conceptual models until a better and more appropriate alternative with robust tool support is developed, that is also addressing the SEMIC methods and practices [see Architectural clarification]. Definition An ontology, also referred to as ontology specification, is a a formal specification describing the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents (e.g. domain experts) [gruber93]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse [wiki-onto]. Description The ontology constitutes the formal (machine-readable) definition of concepts. Although the languages for expressing ontologies vary in expressivity, we shall keep it light and simple, from the formal point of view, with minimal detail and level of expressivity [SC-R2]. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. In the SEMIC context, we only consider lightweight ontologies [defined in rule SC-R2]. Therefore, even if this aspect is not emphasised as \"lightweight ontology\", it is implicitly meant even when simple \"ontology\" reference is used. We assume that the ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language [SC-R1]. The main purpose of this component is to declare the classes, properties, datatypes and controlled lists. Each construct is established by assigning a URI and decorating it with human-readable labels and descriptions, and constitutes the mechanism to establish common references for humans and machines. Definition A data shape specification, also referred to as data shape constraint specification, or simply as data shape constraint or data shape, provides a set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated. Description The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language. This document will refer to data shape constraint specifications simply as \"data shapes\", but occasionally also as \"data shape constraints\" or \"data shape specifications\". Definition A data specification document, also referred to as specification document, is the human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape, or a combination of both. Description A data specification document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to understand (a) how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain, and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose. It is to serve as technical documentation for anyone interested in using (e.g. adopting or extending) a semantic data specification (see [What is a semantic data specification?]). We assume that the data specification documents are published in HTML format (optionally, others). See, for example, the Core Person specification [cpv] or the CPSV-AP specification [cpsv-ap]. Definition A data specification artefact, often referred to as specification artefact or simply artefact, is a materialisation of a semantic data specification in a concrete representation that is appropriate for addressing one or more concerns (e.g. use cases, requirements). Description In the SEMIC context, we consider the following artefact types as primary: ontologies, data shapes, and specification documents. For a description of various concerns addressed in the SEMIC context, please see the section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. Additionally, we are concerned with syntax bindings and serialisation formats (XML/XSD and JSON-LD in particular). Still, these are not in the scope of this document and are addressed elsewhere. For more, see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. Definition A semantic data specification , often called simply data specification, is a union of machine- and human-readable artefacts addressing clearly defined concerns, interoperability scope and use-cases. A semantic data specification comprises at least an ontology and a data shape (or either of them individually) accompanied by a human-readable data specification. Description One general categorisation of semantic data specifications is along the reuse axis. Some semantic data specifications are built with the intent that the terms of the conceptual model can be used in as much as possible contexts. Typically, it is possible to use the terms independently of each other. In this case, the definitions of the terms are usually very broad and abstract, and only the bare minimum of (usage) constraints are expressed. Often, the terms are presented as a list to the reader, with identifiers for each term in the same namespace. Those semantic data specifications are usually denoted with terms such as vocabularies or terminology. On the other side of the spectrum are the data specifications that precisely encode the semantics of the conceptual model that is being used in a single data exchange context, implemented in software or API. They usually have a strong connection with technical data representations (see section on [Technical artefacts and concerns]) and documentations such as XSD schema, OpenAPI specifications, etc. Conceptual models for this purpose will contain precise constraints, technical datatypes, the code-lists that are being used, refer to implementation decisions, etc. Semantic data specifications that are created for that purpose are denoted with Implementation Models. As that name indicate, their objective is to encode the conceptual model of an implementation. Between those two extremes, i.e. contextfree reuse (vocabularies) and unique usage context (Implementation Models), there are semantic data specifications that aim to capture the conceptual model for a broad, yet well-defined, usage context. Typically, these data specifications do not intend to introduce new terms in the conceptual model, but will exploit terms from other semantic data specifications. These exploited terms are augmented with additional usage constraints making the terms more fit for purpose. These semantic data specifications are often denoted with terms such as Application Profiles or Profiles. Readers should understand that the usage relationships between semantic data specifications form a complex network. An attempt to provide a structured view on this network was initiated in the draft W3C Profile Guide [profile-guide]. Also, the Application Profiles do not necessarily have to address all the technical needs related to an implemented system. Distinction between technical and semantic interoperability layers is attempted in this section. This categorisation along the reuse axis indicates the importance of expressing the interoperability scope for semantic data specifications. However, due to the absence of widely accepted definitions for those categories, outlining the exact Dos and Don’ts (for each category), may result to different expectations for each category. This style guide is a document that defines the commonly accepted and applied rules for SEMIC. In the SEMIC context, two types of semantic data specifications are considered: [Core Vocabulary] and [Application Profile]. Semantic data specifications of the third category, Implementation Models, are not part of the activities of SEMIC. Nevertheless, their existence, is taken into account when building the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. Occasionally, this document will refer to semantic data specifications shortly as \"data specifications\". With a similar meaning, the term \"semantic asset\" is used in the literature (e.g. ADMS [adms]). However, in our understanding, the term \"semantic asset\" is broader than \"data specification\" and includes controlled vocabularies and possibly other types of assets. Definition A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable and extensible data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context. Broad context (on vocabularies) On the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as \"terms\") used to describe and represent an area of concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular application, characterise possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only) [vocab]. There is no clear division between what is referred to as \"vocabulary\" and \"ontology\". The trend is to use the word \"ontology\" for a more complex and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas \"vocabulary\" is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or used only in a very loose sense [vocab]. SEMIC context (on Core Vocabularies) Formally, a Core Vocabulary encompasses a lightweight ontology, and, optionally, a (permissive) data shape specification, and it is expressed in a condensed, comprehensive data specification document. CV = lightweight ontology + (optionally) a (permissive) data shape For more details see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. The qualifications lightweight and permissive are used to better emphasise the intention to be reused in the broadest possible context. More precise boundaries are defined further in this document. NOTE: \"Vocabularies\", in general, are not the same as \"controlled vocabularies\", as the latter usually refers to SKOS artefacts. However, in other contexts (similar to SEMIC), a Core Vocabulary might often be simply denoted as \"vocabulary\". Definition An Application Profile is a data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context. It re-uses concepts from one or more semantic data specifications, while adding more specificity, by identifying mandatory, recommended, and optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and providing recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used [dcat-ap]. Description An Application Profile (AP) is a data shape specification which addresses particular application needs (operating within some domain or community) while providing semantic interoperability with other applications based on one or more shared ontologies (vocabularies) [dc-ap]. Formally, the Application Profile encompasses (a) reused ontology specifications (one or many) and (b) its own data shape specification. Optionally it may include (c) reused data shape specifications (one or many), and (d) it may provide its own ontology specification to fill the ontological gaps. AP = reused lightweight ontology + own data shape + (optionally) reused (permissive) data shape + (optionally) own ontology SEMIC context In SEMIC, Application Profiles encompass an ontology, which is largely composed of importing the reused ontologies, complemented with an appropriate data shape specification. Terms that are introduced because of the Application Profile needs are, by preference, added to existing Core Vocabularies. If this is not possible, an Application Profile-specific Vocabulary is created. AP = reused Core Vocabulary + own data shape + (optionally) own ontology The data specification document of an Application Profile is elaborated. It provides the application scope and context, and documents the ontology and the data shapes through the conceptual model. It also provides additional information that stimulates the adoption and correct usage of the AP in implementations. The consumers of SEMIC standards specification can be divided into three categories: business users and domain experts, technicians, software engineers, and software architects, the developers software systems implementing the standards, the machines The SEMIC goal is to bring these groups together, help them \"speak the same language\" and share meaning and conceptual references. Besides the very useful and much needed alignment of domains experts on what concepts mean, it is necessary to bridge the gap between domain experts and the technical experts who implement information systems. Then, the domain experts and business users shall interact with the information systems using the very same set of concepts, agnostic to and undistorted by the technology in the implementation process. Standard semantic data specifications fulfil the purpose keeping these three groups in sync. Ultimately, if the systems are based on standards the purpose is to build interoperable machines - machines that share data with each other and are able to operate on them seamlessly. The developers implement those machine interactions, and therefore the machines and developers must \"find a common language\". However, in order to ensure that the developers take the appropriate steps, the business/domain experts have to interact with them and convey their domain knowledge. This closes the loop: that the machine interactions correspond with the business/domain expert expectations. The data specification shall address the following information needs: visual representation, textual description, machine interpretable representation, and optionally additional representations that facilitate and promote adoption. The aim of this style guide is to ensure the creation of coherent data specifications that can be read and used by domain experts, developers and machines. It is mainly meant for the editors of the data specifications (e.g. semantic engineers, data architects, knowledge modelling specialists). Such data specifications are primarily developed in collaboration with domain experts. To achieve synergy with the domain experts, graphical representation is an indispensable medium that facilitates knowledge elicitation, ideation and knowledge organisation. This becomes especially relevant when shared conceptualisation needs to be attained within a Working Group. The successful application of an ontology or the development of an ontology-based system depends not merely on building a good ontology but also on fitting this into an appropriate development process and implementation into an information system. Generally, computing information models suffer from the intertwining of two types of semantic concerns. As George Box said, \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\", and what a model is useful for depends on what concern it is primarily addressing. On the one hand, the model represents (purely) the domain; on the other hand, it represents the implemented system, which encompasses a representation of the domain (domain knowledge intertwined with technical specificities). These different representation requirements place different demands upon its structure [partridge13]. For example, the concept of \"location\" can be described by domain experts (in a domain model) in a way that is not isomorphic to how the \"location\" class may be appropriately modelled for an information system (i.e., captured in an Implementation Model). One of the common ways to manage this problem is by separating concerns. We take inspiration from OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [mda], which is a well-documented structure where a model is built for each concern, which is transformed into a different model for a different concern. This approach is adapted to the SEMIC needs. Transformation deals with producing different models, viewpoints, or artefacts from a model based on a transformation pattern. In general, transformation can produce one representation from another or cross levels of abstraction or architectural layers [mda-guide]. The Core Vocabularies (CVs) and the specialised Application Profiles (APs) aim to address the following concerns: Domain experts need to agree on the definitions of concepts, relations and their organisation to form a coherent domain model expressed with varying levels of details and expressivity [SC-R2], a shared conceptualisation. This is addressed with conceptual models expressed in UML. The shared conceptualisation needs to be explicitly represented in a usable format (i.e. operated on) by the machines. This is addressed with lightweight ontologies expressed in OWL 2. In practice, to achieve interoperability, it is necessary to provide a (minimum and necessary) set of constraints supporting the ontology instantiation. This is addressed with data shapes expressed in SHACL. To facilitate reuse and understanding, a specification shall be accessible to the community as clear, complete and well-articulated documentation. This is addressed with data specification documents expressed in HTML. In addition, when multiple artefacts addressing each concern are produced, keeping them in synch is a serious editorial and maintenance burden that needs to be considered. On the editorial side the artefacts composing a data specification need to be kept in sync. A modification done in one shall pervade and propagate in all others. This is a difficult, tedious and expensive activity if such synchronisation is to be done manually. Experience shows that using a pivot representation as a single source of truth is a viable solution. Such representation needs to be expressive enough to fulfill all the information needs of the derived artefacts. UML conceptual models can be used as the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. This means it is sufficiently expressive to capture multiple modelling aspects/concerns simultaneously. The other artefacts are then fully or partially derived from the conceptual model. With UML as the single source of truth, the update process is easier to perform as it only has to be done in a single place. The other representations are automatically derived from the conceptual model; the maintenance is less error-prone, uniform and easy [Transformation]. This approach facilitates consistent maintenance of semantic data specification interrelationship and solves the editorial synchronisation problem. However, using UML is not enough, by itself, as the risk of ambiguity and multiple interpretations of the meaning of the UML model elements used in the conceptual model still exists. This risk is mitigated by adopting precise interpretation rules, such as the ones provided in this style guide [CMC-R2]. The different concerns that each data specification is trying to address might lead to different interpretations of the same UML constructs. Therefore, [CMC-R2] defines only a minimal set of such interpretation rules (that can be further extended, if necessary). Additionally, UML cannot cover all potential needs specific to each derived representation. Therefore, the scope of this architecture is limited by what can be expressed in UML and how that information is utilised to generate formal statements. But from our experience it is sufficient to cover all the needs of establishing semantic interoperability standards. Relations between the artefacts are depicted in the figure above. The conceptual model is the source from which a) the data shapes, b) the formal ontology and c) the data specification document can be generated. Each artefact in the figure is qualified with two terms, the representation standard and the most characteristic feature. The conceptual model is expressed in UML language and shall be conformant with the conventions provided in this style guide and the interpretation rules [CMC-R2]. The formal ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language and shall be lightweight as indicated in this convention [SC-R2]. The data shape is expressed in SHACL language and is characterised by the appropriate level of permissiveness [DSC-R2]. The documentation is represented in HTML format and the wording used shall be as precise as possible to capture the meaning accurately and clearly express the intention of the authors. Although not shown in this diagram, the generation of other artefacts is not excluded. For example, more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity) can also be included in the data specification as additional artefacts (see note on [SC-R2]). The figure above depicts that it is also possible to derive from the conceptual model additional artefacts, such as the XSD or JSON schemas and JSON-LD context definitions. These, however, are not addressed in this style guide. One condition the conceptual model shall satisfy is that it shall comply with a set of pre-established conventions (general conventions and UML conventions) and have a fixed interpretation [CMC-R2]. The guidelines in this document enable and constrain the transformation process, making it precise enough to implement a toolchain that automatically performs conformance checking and necessary transformation operations. How this is done, however, is beyond the scope of this document, and the reader may refer to SEMIC toolchain [semic] or other similar implementations such as model2owl [model2owl] or OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain] projects. For any given data specification, various concerns shall be addressed separately, each in a dedicated artefact type. Therefore, the CVs or APs shall be published as a set of artefacts, each addressing a specific concern. The union of these artefacts forms the intended semantic data specification [What is a semantic data specification?]. The table below summarises which artefacts shall be published for each type of data specification addressed in the SEMIC context. Conceptual model (UML) Ontology (OWL 2) Data shape (SHACL) Specification document (HTML) Model diagram (PNG) Core Vocabulary Mandatory Mandatory Optional (shall be permissive) Mandatory Optional (recommended) Application Profile Mandatory Optional (shall be an extension) Mandatory Mandatory Optional (recommended) The semantic data specifications, both CVs and APs, are conceived as a union of specification artefacts, each addressing a different aspect/concern: conceptual model expressed in UML formal ontology expressed in OWL 2 data shapes expressed in SHACL data specification document realised in HTML conceptual model diagrams expressed in any image format (PNG, for example) In the SEMIC context two types of data specifications are of main concern (a) Core Vocabularies designed with broad interoperability goals and (b) Application Profiles designed with application oriented interoperability goals. In this document, we will refer to these data specification types to provide guideline refinements depicting variations based on the data specification type. The primary concern and the intention in each of them differ as follows: Core Vocabularies aim at establishing the shared vocabulary as a lightweight ontology essentially, and optionally some data shapes if necessary [Core Vocabulary]. Application Profiles aim at setting carefully designed data shapes on reused concepts from one or several existent ontologies and, optionally, a minimal ontology with specialised vocabulary [Application Profile]. The secondary concerns are present and common in both data specification types and are, in fact, instrumental to consistent production, maintenance and publication: Editing of the conceptual model Production of data specification document The data specification’s artefacts are not independent but tightly interrelated and transformed from one form into another one. It is difficult to draw a clear line between semantic and technical interoperability artefacts and concerns. This section aims at providing some guidelines and hints on how to distinguish between the two (but no guidelines on technical artefacts are considered as this is out of scope of this work). The best way to look at them is in terms of concerns addressed within each layer, which resembles a lot the discussion on distinguishing \"Conceptual Data Models\", \"Logical Data Models\" and \"Physical Data Models\" in ANSI [ansi] from 1975. EIF [eif] defines the technical interoperability as covering the applications and infrastructures linking systems and services. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to: interface specifications, interconnection services, data integration services, data presentation and exchange, secure communication protocols, access boundaries, information boundaries, etc. The technical layer deals with how to represent, how to transmit data, how the data/entities are bundled when served by a service (i.e. API design or transmission, with impact on performance, usability, and interface), what are the access rights, how is the security ensured, access and storage performance, interfacing with the service, usability, etc. EIF defines the semantic interoperability as ensuring that precise (format and) meaning of exchanged data and information is understood throughout exchanges between parties: \"what is sent is what is understood\". It covers two aspects: semantic and syntactic. The semantic aspect refers to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them. The syntactic aspect refers to describing the exact format of the information to be exchanged in terms of grammar and format. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to developing vocabularies and define data meaning in exchanges. This layer is agnostic to access right, security, transmission protocol, physical representation, how it is presented to the user, etc. In the SEMIC context, Semantic Web and Linked Data technology standards are chosen by default. This means that the syntactic aspect is covered by the RDF specifications [rdf], whereas the semantic aspect is addressed within the Core Vocabulary and Application Profile, expressed in OWL 2 [owl2] and SHACL [shacl] languages. Connecting the semantic layer and the technical layers may not always be straightforward. Three types of technical artefacts are of a particular importance, which rely on three different technologies: XML and XSD, JSON and JSON schema, and relational databases. We briefly comment on each below. RDF. In case the system is gnostic of Semantic Web technologies, if the implementation uses RDF natively, then the technical layer is (near) isomorphic to the semantic specification. There is a perfect alignment. JSON. When system implementation is based on JSON representations, a mapping shall be provided to establish semantics-syntax alignment. Luckily, how such an alignment is done is already specified in the JSON-LD standard specification [json-ld]. It contains a canonical mapping algorithm. The syntaxt semantic binding is provided by the so-called context definitions. As a consequence, if the JSON structure is ought to be aligned with the semantic specification, it imposes a strong constraint on how it shall be organised, otherwise the mapping is not possible. So, an advantage of JSON-LD is that the semantics gets coupled nicely with the syntax, and it is in the reach of the developer. XML. When the system implementation is based on XML representation, then the interplay between syntax and semantics is more problematic, as there is NO canonical way os linking the two. The only transformation we have is the XSLT [xslt] but no mapping language exists like in the case of JSON-LD. Hence, if one provides a mapping to an XSD schema, then one must also provide the XSLT specification that interprets that mapping. Furthermore, when we want to establish an alignment between syntax and semantics there is no constraint on the structure (like in the case of JSON). It is only good practices and alternative technologies, such as RML, that we can rely on in this case. [rml]. RDB. If the implementation is based on relational databases, the story is similar to the XML. There is no organic way of mapping syntax and semantics. The mapping is at the level of the database schema, and there is no canonical way of doing this. So, just like in the case of XML we rely on good practices and alternative technologies to encode an interpretation, such as D2RML [d2rm] and RML [rml]. Ideally, syntax-binding artefacts that show how to map from a semantic data specification into technical layer artefacts is also provided as part of the specification. Showing how to interface with the semantic layer is especially important when Application Profiles (and Implementation Model specifications) are developed and published. In the Semantic Web literature, the term \"reuse\" appears very often, encouraging the adoption of data specifications in new data specifications rather than redefining the same/similar concepts once again. The term \"reuse\" is usually considered in a broad sense, and what it means in terms of specific implementations is often left underspecified. In this section, we aim to address this gap and provide a detailed account of what \"reuse\" means in the SEMIC context. Specification reuse is the act of sourcing an established specification into a new one (referred to as the \"current\" or \"own\" specification). Technically, reuse may mean either or both of the following: Importing (using owl:imports) the contents of another ontology or data shape specification into a current one; OR relying on URI dereferencing to get the formal definition of the ontology (this, however, does not work for the data shapes) In the SEMIC context, for the purpose of interoperability, we need to carefully constrain the meaning of the term \"reuse\" with a fine-grained description on a construct-by-construct basis, and this is the aim of the remainder of this section. The following subsections offer a systematic description of six cases of reuse based on what is reused: (a) a class or (b) a property, and types of frequently encountered variations: (i) as-is, (ii) with terminological adaptations, and (iii) with semantic adaptations. In each case, we describe as appropriate the implications on the following aspects: How to denote it: (a) as-is or (b) as a specialisation Label Definition Impact of adding new properties (for classes only) Impact of reusing original properties (for classes only) Impact on domain and range (for properties only) Other constraints and additional information This scenario applies when the original class is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed New properties on the class In data shapes (SHACL), the class can be used for in domain/range property constraints. In UML, properties are depicted as new connections (object properties) that are incoming and outgoing to the class or as new attributes (data properties) that appear in the class. This works because OWL 2 semantics treats properties as first-class citizens (along with classes, datatypes and individuals). So even if the UML class diagram may visualise new properties on the class, they shall be read as constructs defined separately from one another, just as the OWL 2 specification defines it [owl2]. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Also, make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification In OWL 2 & SHACL, when reusing a class as-is from an established ontology hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class are considered adopted (even if some may be irrelevant). It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In UML, all properties marked as mandatory in the original data specification are considered relevant and shall be depicted. Optional properties may be depicted only if relevant in the new context. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for reuse. This scenario applies when the original class is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-class that captures the adaptations is recommended as the safe option. Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics must stay the same. Differentiation through using preferred and alternative labels is a strong recommendation and should be implemented as described below. In UML, - the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) - the (original) URI of the reused class shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) - the original label of the reused concept shall be preserved (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, - the original label is adopted as is (e.g. either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) - the new label is added as an alternative label (e.g. skos:altLabel) In the documentation, - the new label displayed as the main label (in titles and any other fronting) - the original label (to be visibly mentioned) Definition NO change allowed Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g. skos:scopeNote). New properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Original properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Example For example, the wording of FOAF definitions can benefit from light adaptations and adjustments, yet the meaning is not changing. Hence, in Core Person Vocabulary, the definitions are slightly adjusted. Such adaptations might be made when the original label or definition does not follow the guidelines laid out in this document. For example, the one on circular definitions [GC-R5]. This scenario applies when the original class is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Must reuse as a specialisation. Must create a subclass that captures the adaptations and indicate reuse by the subclass relationship. If the reused class is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused class Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the reused class New properties on the class Add new properties as necessary on the new (owned) sub-class. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification When reusing a class as-is from a data specification, hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class should be adopted. In UML, include all properties and constraints in the UML diagram if marked as mandatory in the original. For the sake of brevity, optional properties and constraints can be omitted. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for the purpose of reuse. If a reused original property must be made more specific or nuanced, then it is a good idea to create a sub-property of the already existing one. See property reuse recommendations below. Example For example, in the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary, the reused class org:Organisation is specialised as cv:PublicOrganisation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed Domain and range If the reused property * does not define a domain and range (in the original ontology) AND * its definition does NOT mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape) then it can be attached in UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) to any class either as a) a relation (pointing to another class) or b) as an attribute with a specific datatype. If the reused property * defines a domain and range (in the original ontology) OR * its definition DOES mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape), then it must be reflected in the UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) accordingly, i.e. it can be applied only on specified classes. When UML is transformed into other representations, it is not recommended to represent the domain/range definitions in the lightweight ontology (OWL 2). Still, it may be reflected in data shape definitions (SHACL) as constraints. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocs, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but better reflect them as constraints in SHACL, where necessary (i.e. optional properties can stay free of domain/range specification) [CS-R2]. Note: in the case of narrow reuse intention, as for the application profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range constraints in the data shape definitions (using SHACL) even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information When reusing a property as-is from a data specification, then all constraints associated with the property should be adopted. It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In no way should the UML contain conflicting constraints compared to the original data specification. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-property that captures the adaptations is recommended as a safe option, however. If the reused property, is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model, and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics MUST stay the same. We strongly recommend differentiating between preferred labels and alternative labels and should be implemented as described below. In UML, * the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) * URI of the reused property shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) * the original label of the reused concept shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, * original label (as is, either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) * new label (as an alternative label, skos:altLabel) In the documentation, * original label (to be visibly mentioned) * new label (in titles and any other fronting) Definition Changes are NOT allowed. Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g., skos:scopeNote ). Domain and range Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Other constraints and additional information Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Example For example, in DCAT-AP the reused property adms:status is relabeled from \"status\" to \"change type\" for Catalogue Record class. Note that the diagram does not reflect this, but it is reflected in the associated documentation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Must create a sub-property that captures the adaptations. In UML, a connector is created denoting a new property, which specialises another connector denoting the original property. Additionally, notes or hyperlinks shall be provided to the original source. Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused property Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the one of the reused property Domain and range If the reused super property does NOT define domain/range, then it is possible to add domain/range specifications to the sub-property, but only if justified and absolutely necessarily. In UML, feel free to attach it anywhere needed. If the reused super property DOES define a domain/range, DO not override them, i.e. do not specify a new domain/range that leads to logical inconsistencies. Specifically, if you do that, then make sure that the new Domain is a subclass of the Original Domain. If the property is used across multiple classes multiple domain/range specifications can be deemed appropriate. This shall be handled with care. Multiple domain/range definitions in OWL 2 mean intersection (i.e. joined by logical AND) and not the union (i.e. joined by logical OR), as most use cases may require. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocabularies, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but optionally reflect them as permissive constraints in SHACL. In case of narrow reuse intention, as for the Application Profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range specifications in the data shape definitions even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information Feel free to provide any additional information that is deemed necessary. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. Example For example, in the DCAT-AP the reused property dct:hasPart is specialised as dcat:dataset. Note that the subproperty relation between the two is not depicted in the diagram, but is stated in the data shape specification. Title: Follow a methodology Identifier MC-R1 Statement: It is strongly recommended that a clear, explicit methodology is adopted for the content development and lifecycle management of a semantic data specification. Conversely, no data specification shall be developed and managed without following a clear methodology. Description: A methodology is a set of methods, processes, and practices that are repeatedly carried out to deliver projects (TOGAF [togaf]). It helps by using a clear set of processes for managing projects that everyone in the organisation understands, reducing risks, and improving the chances of success. A good methodology that fits the context and environment of an organisation can provide clear guidance on what, who, when, and how a project should be done. It also provides a clear path and a systematic strategy to solve the in-field problems. We do not outline a concrete methodology here but merely point to the benefits of adopting and using one. In the SEMIC context, conceptual model development will benefit greatly from embracing some or a combination of techniques and frameworks in data modelling (e.g. Bottom-Up, Top-Down, Case-Based, Entity-Relationship, Object-Oriented, Star/Snowflake Schema data modelling techniques, etc.), ontology engineering methodologies (e.g. Methontology [fernandez-lopez97], DOGMA [jarrar08], OntoClean [guarino04], TOVE [fox92], DILIGENT [pinto04], NeOn [neon], etc. [sure09]), data management body of knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK [dama-dmbok]) or architecture frameworks and practices (e.g. TOGAF [togaf], Zachman Framework [zachman87], EAP [spewak06], etc.). Among other benefits of adopting a clear and well-defined methodology are: Clear lifecycle management Connection between model and expressed (business) requirements Implementation consistency Proper business requirements management (specifications, use cases, scenarios, competency questions, etc. are collected, edited, maintained, referred by the concepts) Title: Scope and goals definition Identifier MC-R2 Statement: A semantic data specification shall have clear goals and a well-established scope definition. Description: Establishing project scope ensures that the modelling work is focused and executed to expectations. It also helps define where the boundary of the model is and what shall be left out. The clearer the scope the higher chances of success are. It shall be possible to determine the scope of a data specification from the use cases for which it is drawn up. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.4] Title: Modularisation Identifier MC-R3 Statement: If a domain contains a lot of concepts that have to be modelled, then it is recommended to partition it into subdomains and manage them as connected modules. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] Description: Divide and conquer method works in many situations, including in the modelling realm. It may not be easy, however, to make a clearcut separation between concepts belonging to one module or another, and such an attempt will certainly bring clarity. Sometimes, a concept can be used for several domains. Then it shall be placed in a separate module. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] The need for modularisation typically emerges when the to-be-modelled space grows. As the terms are to be identified by URIs [PC-R2], it is recommended to include in the used URI structure modularisation potential. Examples: For example, in the eProcurement ontology(ePO) [epo], there is a core ontology and there are extension modules such as eCatalogue, eOrdering, and eNotice [epo] that further refine and extend a specific part of the core. For example, Core Location is used across other Core Vocabularies and is established as a CV on its own. Title: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible Identifier GC-R1 Statement: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible, respecting the original semantics and lexicalisation. Description: Only use constructs with semantics (human and machine-readable) that support the use case or domain. A similar reflex must be considered by reusing properties and classes from other vocabularies. As a general rule, it is safe to reuse annotation properties, as they carry no logical semantics. Conversely, no concepts shall be redefined unless they are significant variations of the existent ones. In order to achieve a common approach to reuse, apply the reuse guidelines as specified above [Clarification on the reuse]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Prefer maintained vocabularies Identifier GC-R2 Statement: Quality of maintenance and governance should be reviewed before reuse. Reuse mostly vocabularies that are well maintained and governed. Description: Some projects are implemented and closed, while some other ones keep being maintained. The maintenance usually aims at (a) fixing errors, (b) making gradual improvements, and (c) supporting users in using the released data specification, to mention the least. Maintenance of the project can also include URI dereferencing and handling open issues in a timely fashion. Some projects may foresee an evolution roadmap, defined in a change and release policy, with a series of evolution stages planned. Title: Concept reference and terms Identifier GC-R3 Statement: Each concept shall be (a) referenceable by a URI, (b) formally defined and (c) described by a precise, unambiguous human-readable label and definition. Description: Terms and concepts are not the same things. A term is a word, compound word, or multi-word expression that, in specific contexts, is given specific meanings – these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well-named (termed) by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. So, we need a precise way to refer to concepts. The mechanism offering such a possibility is using URIs to establish the identity of a concept’s \"meaning\". URIs also enable referencing, an essential feature of meaning exchange (communication). Such a reference allows for establishing a common meaning, not only between humans and machines but also among humans. Finally, the meaning of the term must be clear. Its definition is associated with the term via the URI. To make the term reusable, it should be published as part of a data specification. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Vocabulary terminology style Identifier GC-R4 Statement: The terminology style shall be consistent across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, some variation in terminology style (concept naming conventions) can be noticed across a wide range of semantic data specifications. Whatever the adopted style may be, the author shall consistently apply it to the whole model. These names will be reflected in all artefacts and in the URIs. Next, we provide a set of loose recommendations: British English is the lingua franca in the model. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations in concept names Classes are names with nouns and singular Names are case-sensitive. Relations and Properties use verbs at a present tense Some practices suggest adding the prefix \"has\" for quality attributes like \"weight\", \"height\", etc. or the prefix or \"is\" for boolean indicators, and some other practices recommend avoiding such prefixes as they add no additional information to the name. Most often, the name of the inverse relation should not be a semantically inverted verb, such as in the case of \"buys/sells\" or \"opens/closes\". It should be done by changing the voice from active to passive, e.g. \"plays/playedBy\". Title: Vocabulary definition styling Identifier GC-R5 Statement: The concept definitions shall be elaborated consistently across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, different styles of defining concepts can be noticed across a range of semantic data specifications. The SEMIC Principles for creating good definitions [semic-defs] are a basis for writing definitions. They are based on advice found in the literature and are the following: Be concise but complete, Avoid over-generalisations. Adapt and contextualise the definition to the surrounding/connected concepts. Make sure that every concept that occurs in the model is directly (or indirectly) defined Describe only one term Structure the definition in a standardised way: Use the singular form to phrase the definition [GC-R4] State what the term is, and don’t enumerate what it is NOT (no negative definition) Use only commonly understood abbreviations Use similar terminology for related definitions Don’t use circular definitions, i.e. the term defined should not be part of the definition, Don’t add secondary information such as additional explanation, scoping, examples, etc. these are to be documented in usage notes. Form the definition in one or more sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a period. Do not start a definition with a repetition of the name of the concept. Rich standard encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 are supported in notes and definitions. In the element names, however, we recommend avoiding any character encodings and using plain ASCII [epo-cmc, sec 4.2]. Title: Reuse compliance Identifier GC-R6 Statement: Compliance with a semantic data specification is satisfied by appropriate usage of terms that is in accordance with definitions and constraints. Compliance checking with an application semantic data specification shall be permissive. This means that what is not forbidden is permitted. If the context requires more restrictions,then an application profile needs to be established for a narrow(er) scenario. Technically, we envisage compliance checking limited to correct referencing of the concept URIs and respecting the cardinality constraints and value constraints in the case of properties. This falls within the scope of data shape definitions. Additionally, more specific compliance requirements and constraints can be added as necessary. Compliance checking may involve multiple levels of severity. For example in the SHACL specifications three levels are defined: Violation, Warning, Info. We assume by default the SHACL severity specifications unless other denotations systems are provided (i.e. different labels and delimitation of severity). Also in absense of specifications, any unfulfilled compliance check is considered a Violation. The semantic data specifications may provide such severity levels. How it is realised in the conceptual model is open at the moment. The main place to provide such specifications is the data shape artefact. In the future we can return to this aspect and provide more guidance. Title: Deontic modals Identifier GC-R7 Statement: Indicators of deontic modalities for classes and properties do not have semantic or normative value. Still they may be used as editorial annotations. Deontic modalities indicate levels obligation, permission, necessity and related concepts. As a general recommendation, to use deontic indicators in the semantic data specifications is discouraged. Such indicators could be of editorial or guiding role for the users and adopters of the data specifications. However, it should be noted that they are not considered as part of any compliance validation or semantic interpretation of the data model. In the standardisation community a common practice is to indicate levels of obligation or permission for concepts in a semantic data specification. Obligation indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is required in an instantiation; while, Permission indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is allowed or forbidden in an instantiation. The common deontic indicator values are: mandatory signifying that a statement using a class or property is required, recommended signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional but recommended, optional signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional, forbidden signifying that a statement using a class or property is not permitted. Still, there are ways to achieve the same effect as the these indicators through other means. For properties, the main instrument is employment of cardinality constraints (per property per class). To make a property mandatory set the minimum cardinality to one or more [1..*], otherwise relax the minimum cardinality constraint to keep the property optional [0..*]. For classes, it is possible to mark a class as abstract, which means that it cannot be directly instantiated, therefore achieving the effect of forbidden. However, deontic indicators shall be avoided for classes because a class may be mandatory and optional in different instantiation or exchange scenarios within the same application profile. For example consider the DCAT-AP and two mandatory classes: dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset. When metadata of a catalogue (and its records) is exchanged, then both classes dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset must be instantiated; however when a single dataset metadata is being exchange then only dcat:Dataset instance shall be provided. Moreover, in the second scenario, providing an instance of dcat:Catalog will be counterproductive and possible leading to errors. Descriptions of what classes can or shall be bundled together when participating in information exchange belong in \"data exchange contracts\", \"API endpoint scheme definitions\" or the likes of these. Such specifications belong in the Technical Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif], and are (currently) out of scope of this style guide, which aims primarily at addressing the semantic interoperability. If semantic engineers prefer or are compelled to employ deontic indicators, then deontic indicators must be precisely defined and those definitions must be published. No reliance on common sense understanding shall be assumed as the meaning of such deontic indicators may (and certainly) differ not only among readers of data specifications but also in different data specifications. Title: Conceptual model as single source of truth Identifier CMC-R1 Statement The UML conceptual model should be used as single source of truth. Description By applying this principle, we can achieve consistency among all derived artefacts. This implies: Standard representation of the UML, such as XMI Existence of a well-defined set of rules and conventions to transform UML model into other artefacts, which can be executed, as much as possible automatically, by a dedicated software tool or toolchain [CMC-R2] It is recommended that recent versions of the UML (v2.5+) and XMI (v2.5+) specifications are used [epo-cmc, sec 4.1]. Title: Fixed UML interpretation Identifier CMC-R2 Statement: The UML conceptual model must have a fixed interpretation. Description: Using UML as a graphical language to encode a data specification according to the reuse guidelines requires defining a set of pre-established conventions on the UML notation to reach a fixed interpretation. The interpretation of UML as a logical structure, including OWL 2, was and still is an active research topic. But even the OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel [omg-onto] does not address the notion of reuse. The goal of using UML is to provide for the SEMIC semantic data specifications a standard graphical notation, which many are familiar with. Therefore, the graphical notation should facilitate the understanding of the data specification. The UML notation should match the semantics that are to be expressed in the data specification (the ontology, data shapes and human-readable documentation). The UML is the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. Using the conventions and associated interpretation expressed in this rule, other artefacts are derived from the UML. The benefit of defining such a precise set of mapping rules is that it allows for: Implementing tools to transform UML into derivative artefacts, thus enabling UML as the single source of truth. Implementing tools for formal checking against the established conventions (interpretation), thus enforcing correctness, conformance and consistency. These rules will increase the coherency of the UML diagrams across projects and organisations. Within SEMIC, the interpretation is implemented by the SEMIC toolchain [semic]. The table below provides recommended interpretations of UML elements in OWL 2 and SHACL. These interpretations can be considered high-level mapping rules implementable into transformation tools that generate OWL 2 ontology and, respectively, SHACL constraints from the UML conceptual model. UML model element OWL 2 ontology element SHACL data shape element Class OWL 2 Class SHACL Node Shape Abstract class SHACL Node Shape with a SPARQL constraint that selects all instances of this class Attribute OWL 2 datatype or object property, based on their type. Property constraint, within the SHACL Node Shape corresponding to the source UML class (but the constraints are mentioned below on type and multiplicity) Attribute type Property constraint, within the SHACL Node Shape corresponding to the UML class, indicating the range class or datatype. Attribute multiplicity Property constraint(s), within the SHACL Node Association (target/source role names) Object property declaration axiom for the target (or source, or both) end of the association. Association source Optional domain declaration (data shape constraints shall be preferred). Property constraint, within the SHACL Node Shape corresponding to the source UML class (but the constraints are mentioned below on target and multiplicity) Association target Optional property range declaration (data shape constraints shall be preferred). Property constraint, within the SHACL Node Shape corresponding to the source UML class, indicating the range class Association multiplicity Property constraints, within the SHACL Node Shape corresponding to the source UML class, indicating the minimum and/or maximum or exact cardinality (similar to Attribute multiplicity). Association symmetry SPARQL constraint, within the SHACL Node Shape, corresponding to the UML constraint, within the class, which selects instances connected by the object property in a reciprocal manner. Association inverse (for bidirectional associations only) Two object property declaration axioms, one for the target and the second for the source end of the association, and a declaration that the two properties stand in an inverse relationship to one another. Dependency Object property declaration axiom for the target end of the association. Dependency source Property constraint, within the SHACL Node Shape corresponding to the source UML class (but the constraints are mentioned below on target and multiplicity) Dependency target Property constraints, within the SHACL Node Shape corresponding to the source UML class, indicating (a) the range class is skos:Concept and (b) the value is skos:inScheme the target name (expected an enumeration). Dependency multiplicity Property constraints within the SHACL Class generalisation Subclass axiom between the classes corresponding to the UML classes. Property generalisation Sub-property axiom for the generalisation between UML associations and dependencies. Examples: The UML interpretation applied by the SEMIC toolchain is described in [semic-toolchain]. To assist the editor while data modelling to choose the best representation, a test suite is available covering all modelling patterns. The SEMIC toolchain shares the same interpretation as the OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain]. In the context of eProcurement ontology, a toolchain has been developed to transform and validate UML models. Such tools are based on two documents: UML convention specifications [epo-cmc] and UML transformation specifications [epo-cm2owl]. Title: Element names and URIs Identifier CMC-R3 Statement: All UML Element names should be fit for URI generation with clear namespace organisation. Description: This convention aims at ensuring that URIs can be generated from UML Element names and shall be treated as an extension to the terminology style conventions [GC-R4]. The Element names are intended as human-readable denominations (called labels) and as machine-readable denominations (called identifiers). This means that the Element names serve as the primary source for generating URIs [puri-bp] to ensure unambiguous machine-readable reference to a formal construct. serve as the primary source for generating labels to ensure human readers' comprehension follow an organisation of namespaces Thus, in the UML model, the Element names must conform to RDF [rdf] and XML [xml] format specifications. Both languages effectively require that terms begin with an upper or lower case letter from the ASCII character set or an underscore (_). This tight restriction means that, for example, terms may not begin with a number, hyphen or accented character [cv-meth]. Although underscores are permitted, they are discouraged as they may be, in some cases, misread as spaces. A formal definition of these restrictions is given in the XML specification document [xml]. Note that, when the UML Element name cannot be used to effectively denominate and identify the concept then, UML Element Tags may be used to express explicitly URIs, labels, notes and other types of annotations [CMC-R6]. Internationalisation, if required, should be provided through the use of the UML Element Tags to specify labels that will be used for generation of specification documents in languages other than English. Country specific data specifications, which are meant to be used primarily at a national level, might decide to relax on this convention and permit the use of Unicode characters in the Element names, which will result in the generations of IRIs, instead of URIs [iri]. However, this is unnecessary, and strongly discouraged, in the SEMIC context. Following this convention is also important in the context of generation of persistent URIs [PC-R2] according to the principles laid out in [10rules-puri]. Examples: The class Address in Core Location has several properties. All the properties have a displayed name (e.g. \"addressArea\") with the UML class diagram and associated UML Tags, such as a label for the HTML specification (\"address area\"), definition, usage note and the related URI. Title: Case sensitivity and charset Identifier CMC-R4 Statement: All UML Element names are case-sensitive and shall follow the CamelCase convention. Description: The names begin with an upper or lower case letter (A–Z, a–z) for all terms in the model. Digits (0–9) are allowed in the subsequent character positions. [epo-cmc, sec 4.2] Moreover, we can significantly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent capitalisation for concept names; therefore, UML Element names shall be CamelCased [epo-cmc, sec 3.2], [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.20]. The names of UML Classes shall start with an upper-case letter, UML Attributes shall start with a lower-case letter, UML Connectors (including Target Roles and Source Roles) shall start with a lower-case letter. The names of UML Enumerations, Packages and Datatypes may start with a lower-case or upper-case letter. Examples: In the image below, there are two classes from Core Location with the related properties and a relation between them. The name of the classes are in UpperCamelCase, the name of the properties are in lowerCamelCase and the relation (adminUnit) is in lowerCamelCase. Title: Namespaces and prefixes in element names Identifier CMC-R5 Statement: Element names shall be organised by namespaces. Namespaces may be indicated through prefixes delimited by colon (:) character, forming qualified names. Description: To enable the reuse of names defined in other models, and the reuse of unique references for names that support easy identification, namespace management must be considered. We adopt the XML and RDF approach to defining and managing namespaces [xml-ns]. A namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organise objects of various kinds so that these objects may be referred to by name and uniquely identifiable [urn]. A qualified name denotes the URI, which is composed of concatenating the expanded prefix with the local segment [turtle]. A qualified name is a name subject to namespace interpretation [xml-ns]. Syntactically, they are either prefixed names or un-prefixed names. A binding declaration shall be maintained, which binds prefixes to namespace URIs and a default namespace applicable to un-prefixed Element names. As the Element name is the primary source for deriving URIs, a base URI and a local segment are necessary. The Element name prefix, before the colon, plays the role of namespace name indicating which base URI shall be used, while the Element name, after the colon, is the local segment. See [xml-ns] for more info. In case the editor decides to omit to specify a prefix in the Element name when a URI generation logic is devised, an implicit prefix can be assumed by default. The qualified names may be structured as follows: prefix:localSegment :localSegment localSegment Note: The prefixes and namespaces shall be well-defined, maintained, and published as part of the data specification. Examples: When dcat a namespace name is declared as bound to base URI http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#, then dcat:Catalog is the qualified name from which the http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Catalog URI is interpreted. When cv (short for Core Vocabularies) namespace name is declared bound to base URI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/, then cv:adminUnit is the qualified name from which the http://data.europa.eu/m8g/adminUnit URI is generated. Title: Rich annotations through tags Identifier CMC-R6 Statement: UML Tags can be conveniently used for annotating the Elements. Description: UML Element tags are key-value pairs that are associated with a UML Element (class, attribute, connector, etc.). The tags can be used as an extension mechanism to the UML language. They can be used to provide information that is not expressible anywhere else on a UML Element. For example, in this style guide, we recommend that the UML Element name shall be used to derive both the concept URI and the concept preferred label. However, if the model editor chooses to use the UML Element name for deriving the concept label alone, then the URI needs to be specified elsewhere. This is one example of how the UML tags can be used: simply specify a new tag, \"uri\", and provide the concept URI as a value (see figure below). Another example where tags came in handy is the provisioning of notes of various types. According to the UML standard, UML Elements have only one general description. We recommend using this description solely for definitions. Yet the scope notes, examples, alternative labels, and any other annotations can be provisioned through the UML tagging mechanism (see figure below). Examples: Title: Explicit depiction of external dependencies Identifier CMC-R7 Statement: The UML diagrams should depict how the developed model relates to external (reused) models. Description: UML does not support an import mechanism comparable to the one specified in OWL 2. Yet, the reuse of models is a highly encouraged practice. To accommodate such practice, the reused Elements shall be created as in the original model and depicted in diagrams. The external Elements shall be clearly marked. The easiest way to do so is by providing a namespace prefix. The original meaning shall be preserved without changes to the labels, concept definitions or URIs. Reused classes shall be depicted in the UML diagrams. Reused properties shall be depicted in diagrams as connectors and attributes. It is not necessary to depict unused classes or properties [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.7]. Examples: In the example below, a Core Vocabulary Person includes concepts from another vocabulary (FOAF); thus the two classes Person and Agent have the \"foaf\" namespace prefix specified in front. Please note that this is an example of reuse with semantic adaptation. In CPV the Person is more restricted than that in FOAF. The foaf:Person class represents people. Something is a foaf:Person if it is a person, and it does not matter whether they are alive, dead, real or imaginary. The foaf:Person class is a subclass of the foaf:Agent class, since all people are considered 'agents' in FOAF. In contrast to that, cpv:Person is defined differently: A individual human being who may be dead or alive, but not imaginary. Hence, the subclass relation. Title: Class inheritance Identifier CMC-R8 Statement: Ensure that the attributes and associations of a superclass apply to all its subclasses. Description: This is a general modelling principle that should be respected, yet when it comes to reusing, such a requirement is often overlooked. This means that the model editor shall carefully analyse the reused model as a whole and how it is integrated with their own model. Examples: In Core Business Vocabulary, the class LegalEntity is a subclass of org:FormalOrganization from the Organization Ontology (which is a subclass of org:Organization, which is a subclass of foaf:Agent), and different properties/relations have been inherited such as hasSubOrganization, hasMember, name, type. See more [oslo-rules sec 3.2.3] Title: Abstract classes Identifier CMC-R9 Statement: Classes that are not intended to be instantiated directly can be marked as abstract. Description: When a (super-)class is created for capturing a level of abstraction in the domain knowledge, it may not always be suitable for instantiation. Editors may choose to mark such classes as abstract and to indicate that their subclasses shall be used in practice. In UML, this can be done via > stereotype [see CMC-R17: Using stereotypes]. Doing so has no impact on the OWL 2 [owl2] representation of the model (as this cannot be expressed in OWL). However, depending on the toolchain implementation, SHACL data shapes [shacl] can be generated to express that no instances of this class shall not occur in the data. See [oslo-rules sec 3.2.6, epo-cmc, sec 4.4] Examples: Both OSLO [oslo-toolchain] and ePO [epo] toolchains support such stereotypes. Title: Attribute definition and usage Identifier CMC-R10 Statement: UML Attributes shall be used to define properties taking simple datatype values. An attribute declaration should specify its datatype and multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: We recommend atomic types are used as attribute types and avoid using another class as the attribute type. Instead, those should be expressed as relationships (represented by Association connectors) between the two classes [CMC-R12]. The reason for this is to keep a clear separation between (a) properties that take a literal value (governed by a datatype, and conceptually corresponding to owl:DatatypeProperty) and (b) properties that take a reference value (governed by a class, corresponding to owl:ObjectProperty). Doing so has two advantages: (a) it confers homogeneity to the model, which enhances readability and decreases ambiguity; (b) the toolchain implementation is easier as there is a clear treatment and interpretation. literal properties (expressed as attributes datatypes) and relations between two classes (expressed as association connectors). The advantage of In case of primitive datatypes, high preference shall be given to using OWL 2 compliant XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf] standard datatypes. For more detailed recommendations on the use of primitive datatypes see convention [CMC-R18]. Properties whose values come from a controlled vocabulary or authority table constitute a special case, because two modelling practices are recognised here: (a) as attributes with type \"Code\", and (b) as dependency relations pointing to a UML Enumeration named after the controlled list. In the first case, the attribute type \"Code\" shall be mapped to the skos:Concept class. The advantage of this approach is the compactness of the diagrams, as fewer boxes appear in them. The disadvantage is the omission to specify precisely, which list the property values are restricted to. Arguably, the controlled list can be provided via the additional UML Tags [CMC-R6], but that value will not be visible in the diagrams. In the second case, the property is modelled not as an attribute but by using a UML Dependency connector between the UML Class, and the UML Enumeration representing the controlled list, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It denotes that the OWL 2 class has an owl:ObjectProperty whose range is of type skos:Concept and is limited to values of the specified controlled vocabulary. The connector must have a \"Source→Target\" direction. No other directions are acceptable, and a valid target role name and multiplicity shall be provided [CMC-R14]. Finally, we emphasise that UML Connectors are reserved for the object properties only. Hence, none shall be established between a UML Class element and a UML Datatype element. Examples: Here we provide an example for the two approaches of specifying attribute datatypes described above. In the CCCEV specification, the class attributes of the Requirement and Evidence classes use loose UML and other datatypes: String, Literal, and Code. No precise definition of what they mean is provided. The attributes are left underspecified, and with generic datatypes: the description attribute is a generic String, while the type and confidentialityLevelType attributes are specified as Code (without explicitly indicating what this datatype means). It is also not clear what would be the difference between Literal and String, although one might gain an intuition from the attribute names. The same classes are reused in the ePO ontology, where the cccev:Requirement and cccev:Evidence class attributes explicitly specify standard datatypes and cardinalities. Additionally, the cccev:confidentialityLevelType attribute, and also the cccev:type attribute, although not depicted in the screenshot, indicated in the original specification, were converted to dependency connectors, because they are not using an atomic datatype, but rather a controlled list of skos:Concept(s) coming from controlled vocabularies, such as at-voc:confidentiality-level. Title: Multiplicity of attributes and connectors Identifier CMC-R11 Statement: The multiplicity of connectors and class attributes should be specified, indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. The cardinality shall be as permissive as possible in Core Vocabularies and as restrictive as necessary in Application Profiles. Description: If the UML model is developed to represent a Core Vocabulary, then the property cardinality (both UML Attributes and UML Association) shall be as permissive as possible, for example, [0..*], meaning any occurrence is allowed. If a structural feature (attribute or association) is irrelevant for the domain or the applications, instead of setting a lower limit of multiplicity to 0, simply remove it from the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. However, in the UML models representing Application Profiles, special attention shall be given to the multiplicity, reducing variation in the instance data to a minimum. And if a property (attribute or connector) is mandatory in the data, then its minimum cardinality shall be set to 1, for example [1..*] [epo-cmc, sec 4.5]. A good practice is to always indicate cardinality. It may be left unspecified, but this is not recommended. When in doubt, it is recommended to fall back on the implicit assumption of [0..*]. Not to be confused with the default cardinality assumed in tools. For example, Enterprise Architect by default assumes [1..1] cardinality for attributes and omits to display it; and a similar default assumption exists in XML/XSD. Notation for multiple cardinality can be either with * or n. In principle using either notation is fine, however, it is recommended to use only one of those notations within a given data specification consistently, if possible, to enhance readability. It is worth highlighting this, as some UML tools, by default, might use a different notation for multiple cardinality depending on whether it is specifying the cardinality of attributes vs. that of connectors. The UML processing tools should be implemented so as to handle either of those notations, as their meaning is identical. Unless, well explained, no rigid constraints shall be imposed on attributes and associations. In other words, if specified, the cardinality shall be the most permissive, where possible [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Limit the constraints to business rules, do not add technical constraints to the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.16]. If an attribute or an association from a reused vocabulary is irrelevant, do not set the lower limit of multiplicity to 0, but simply omit it in the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Examples: All Core Vocabularies have set a permissive cardinality [0..*], for example, all the properties of Public Organisation, shown with ligh orange background, have multiplicity [0..*], while the same Public Organisation reused in CPSV-AP, shown in blue, has mandatory properties: Title: Connector definition and usage Identifier CMC-R12 Statement: UML Connectors shall be used to define relations and properties taking non-atomic type values. A connector declaration should specify multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: UML Connectors shall be used to denote object properties (see OWL 2 semantics, [owl2]). First, we explain how the connectors ought to be used, i.e., where to specify the relationship names and multiplicity. Then we explain the optional usage of the dependency connector type. On connector names, a generic UML connector may have a name applied to it, and it may have source/target roles specified in addition. This provides flexibility to how the domain knowledge may be expressed in UML; however, this freedom increases the level of ambiguity as well. Therefore, we foresee two distinct ways to express properties: using the connector (generic) name or using the connector source/target ends. We strongly recommend using the source/target role name to indicate the relation name and leave empty the (generic) element name. So, if a target role is specified, then no connector name can be specified. Optionally a source role may be provided to indicate the inverse relation. In this case, the relation direction must be changed from \"Source → Target\" to \"Bidirectional\". Or conversely, if the connector direction is \"Bidirectional\", then source and target roles must be provided. No other directions are permitted. It is recommended that each association has a definition. The definition is then used for each role as they represent the same meaning manifested in the inverse direction. Alternatively, definitions can be specified along the target and source roles. UML defines multiple types of connectors. We recommend relying mainly on the UML Association connector type. Optionally a UML Dependency Connector type may be used if the meaning and usage conditions are well-defined. The UML Association connectors represent relations between a source and a target classes. The association connector cannot be used between other kinds of UML Elements. The UML Dependency connector may be used between a UML Class and UML Enumeration boxes, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It indicates the class has an owl:ObjectProperty, whose range is a controlled vocabulary [CMC-R14]. The connector must have the direction \"Source → Target\". No other directions are acceptable. The UML Generalization connector signifies a class-subClass relation and is transformed into rdfs:subClassOf relation standing between a source and target classes. The connector must have no name or source/target roles specified in the UML model. If a model class should inherit a class from an external model, then proxies must be created for those classes [GC-R1, Reuse of a class with semantic adaptation]. For example, if Person specialises a foaf:Agent. Title: All elements are \"public\" Identifier CMC-R13 Statement: The visibility of all UML Elements should be \"public\". Description: For semantic data specifications, accessibility to the information is not a concern. The sole concern is to specify the semantics of the information as precisely as possible. Therefore, the UML access or privacy annotations shall not be interpreted, and the \"+\" symbol shall always be used next to each property. This symbol means \"public\" [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.22]. Examples: The Person class in Core Vocabulary Person only has public properties indicated with a \"+\" symbol next to each property. Title: Controlled lists as Enumerations Identifier CMC-R14 Statement: The controlled lists of values shall be referred to as UML Enumerations and specified whenever possible. Description: References to controlled lists shall be done via UML Enumeration elements. Content and lifecycle management of controlled lists shall be separated from the management of the semantic data specification. Controlled lists play an essential role in establishing interoperability standards. Management and publication of controlled lists are not part of this style guide. The expectation is that the controlled lists are published in accordance with best practices and represented with the SKOS model using persistent identifiers. In such an approach, the controlled list is expressed as a skos:ConceptScheme and the specific values as skos:Concept(s). Also, such controlled lists are often developed, published and maintained independently following their own lifecycle, so that they can be reused in other models. Two use-cases can be identified in practice: (a) when the code list is known and is explicitly referred to as the range of a property, and (b) when a property is modelled but no code list reference is provided as its range. When the authors of a conceptual model intend to omit which controlled list shall be used, then a class attribute with the range skos:Concept (in some cases Code is preferred) can be created to indicate that. This approach can be useful in situations when multiple (external) controlled lists can be used interchangeably. For example, the adms:status property of a dcat:CatalogueRecord shall be a skos:Concept, without specifying the controlled list. It is advisable, however, to be specific concerning which controlled list shall be used. In such cases, an Enumeration shall be created representing the controlled list. The Enumeration shall be empty, i.e., not specifying any value, because the values are assumed to be maintained externally and only the reference is necessary. The properties having this controlled list as range shall be depicted as UML connectors (dependencies or associations) between a Class and an Enumeration [CMC-R2]. For example, in ePO, dct:Location can have a country code represented as a dependency relation to at-voc:country (the country authority table published on the EU Vocabularies website). The name of the Enumeration shall be resolved to a URI identical to that of the skos:ConceptScheme. As for the connector type we recommend using a dependency connector (depicted with a dashed line) because the semantic interpretation differs slightly from the association connector (depicted with a continuous line). Namely, the range of the property has to fulfil two constraints: (a) instantiating the skos:Concept class and (b) being skos:inScheme the intended controlled list [epo-arch]. If the controlled list is specific to the model then the author shall define the values of the UML Enumeration inside of it, which are interpreted as concepts belonging to the containing concept scheme [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.17]. Examples: The COFOG controlled list is suggested in Core Public Organisation to describe the purpose of an Organisation (as depicted in the image on top) while in CPSV-AP, the same COFOG list is used to indicate the functions of government which a public service is intended for (as depicted in the image below). While the COFOG controlled list is owned by the UN and maintained by the Publications Office in the form of SKOS concept schemes, it can be reused by the Core Public Organisation and CPSV-AP independently. Title: Partition the model into packages Identifier CMC-R15 Statement: Packages have no semantic value, but shall be used whenever possible to logically organise the model. Description: It is highly recommended to avoid defining any semantic interpretation into UML Packages, as they are best used for organisational purposes, defining logical partitions in the model. Therefore, packages can serve as a method of slicing the conceptual model into subdomains. It is also possible to use packages as namespace indicators. Although it works well for classes, it fails to cover the needs for managing namespaces of connectors and attributes. Moreover, it does not work in cases when an attribute, or a connector is used multiple times in several packages. Hence, namespace management is easier attained by using other methods such as using prefixes in Element names or using Element tags [epo-cmc, sec 4.3]. Examples: In the image below, each class is organised in a package mapped to a namespace. However, for convenience, Core Vocabularies are in multiple packages but mapped to the same namespace. Title: Diagram readability Identifier CMC-R16 Statement: UML class diagrams shall be organised for readability. Description: UML class diagrams are used for depicting the conceptual model. Their primary purpose is to construe the meaning of concepts, relations and their organisation to the human reader. Therefore, the diagrams shall be optimised for readability. We recommend that the diagrams: are well spaced (proper space between lines, boxes and labels) minimise the number of crossing connectors prefer orthogonal to straight connectors align elements horizontally & vertically space elements evenly avoid overlapping labels and depict all labels align labels horizontally and avoid vertical or oblique alignment place subclasses under or to the right of their parent place the part under or to the right of the whole at aggregates or composites . minimise the number of details are short and concise (multiple small(-er) diagrams are preferred to one large diagram) diagram size: prefer multiple themed small(er) diagrams to large and crowded ones diagrams shall not be bigger than one A4 page simplify complex diagrams: by breaking it down into several smaller diagrams by highlighting certain parts of the diagram by hiding attributes, role names, etc. that are not relevant symbol size: symbols should be equal nothing shall draw more attention unless intended elements of equal importance should be equally large inherited attributes of a superclass shall be visible if the superclass is not in the diagram See also [ oslo-rules, semic-sgdraft ] Examples: In the example below, taken from Core Person, the classes are aligned vertically and horizontally, subclasses are placed just below the related parent class, the relations are horizontal, vertical, or orthogonal. Title: Element stereotypes Identifier CMC-R17 Statement: Stereotypes do not have semantic or normative value. They shall be avoided in the conceptual models unless a good motivation, and a strong need is provided. Description: We strongly encourage semantic practitioners to avoid stereotypes of any normative or semantic value. One common usage of stereotypes is to provide deontic indicators. See [GC-7 on Deontic modals] where we explain why their use is discouraged and what can be done instead. There is a practice to mark some classes as \"abstract\" with the intention of preventing those from being instantiated. This is also a technical level constraint and does not belong in the semantic layer. We acknowledge that stereotypes can be useful for editorial and dissemination purposes; to indicate a classification or grouping of a specific sort. Stereotypes can be used to support concerns specific to an implementation of the transformation toolchain. See the examples below. Examples: Stereotypes can be used to indicate what content goes into various output file during the transformation process. Stereotypes can be used to visually group the class attributes. When applied on the relations (UMl connectors) stereotypes have the opposite effect: that of cluttering and decrease the diagram readability. Title: Datatype definition and usage Identifier CMC-R18 Statement: We strongly recommend that only OWL 2 compliant datatypes are used. The creation of custom datatypes shall be avoided. Description: Similar to [epo-cmc, sec 4.7], this convention draws the distinction between primitive (or atomic) types (consisting of single literal value) and composite types (consisting of multiple attributes) (see also [cv-handbook, sec 3.1]). In fact, the composite datatypes must be defined as classes and handled as such. For example, Amount, Identifier, Quantity and Measurement are to be treated as classes, even if conceptually they could be seen as composite datatypes. It is recommended to employ the primitive datatypes that are already defined in XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf], in particular a subset of those that is OWL 2 compliant. This should cover the standard, and most common types. Thus, definitions of custom datatypes shall be avoided unless the model really needs them. Such cases are, however, rare. The reason for avoiding complex datatypes, is that once we start structuring how data shall be organised, besides syntactic definitions, we inevitably embed semantic aspects as well. Doing so, the semantics of the structure is obscured and trapped in a technical interoperability layer. For example, xsd:duration encodes both the amount(s) and unit(s) of time into a regular expression that looks like this P5Y2M10D. The definition of datatypes in the UML model should be also avoided, even in cases where a toolchain performing the transformation of UML can automatically resolve those into their XSD equivalent using a correspondence table, such as the one presented below. Note that from the family of string datatypes we recommend using the following ones (in this order of preference): rdf:PlainLiteral, rdfs:Literal, xsd:string, and rdf:langString. Often enabling multilingual data specification is a necessity. UML XSD Boolean xsd:boolean Float xsd:float Integer xsd:integer Character, String xsd:string / rdf:langString Short xsd:short Long xsd:long Decimal xsd:decimal Date xsd:date DateTime xsd:dateTime xsd:anyURI Code see CMC-R14 We strongly recommended the use of OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF standard datatypes, if possible. They might be useful also for indicating a specific datatype, which is not possible with the UML ones. For example, making a distinction between a general string (xsd:string) and a literal with a language tag (rdf:langString), or XML encoded ones such as rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral. The table above provides a simplified correspondence between UML and XSD datatypes, but for a complete list of available recommended datatypes the standard specifications shall be consulted: RDF working group XSD Datatype maps RDF 1.1 Datatypes section OWL 2 Datatype Maps Title: Formal language choice Identifier SC-R1 Statement: The formal ontology shall be expressed in OWL 2. Description: In the Semantic Web domain, two formal languages can be used for expressing the ontology: RDFS [rdfs] and OWL 2 [owl2]. RDFS is simpler and only allows for some of the recommended expressions (for example, the distinction between datatype and object properties is not possible). OWL 2 is more complex and more expressive than RDFS. We recommend using only a limited set of expression types available in OWL 2 language [SC-R2]. Examples: Core Vocabularies have an RDF representation as OWL 2 Ontology. In the example below, part of Core Person is depicted: @prefix dc: . @prefix foaf: . @prefix owl: . @prefix rdf: . @prefix rdfs: . @prefix schemas: . @prefix xsd: . a rdfs:Class; rdfs:label \"Person\"@en . a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; dc:mediator [ foaf:homepage ; foaf:name \"Semantic Interoperability Community (SEMIC)\" ]. Title: Limited (OWL 2) expressivity Identifier SC-R2 Statement: The formal ontology shall be lightweight in its logical underpinning, focusing mainly on the concept declarations, generalisation axioms and annotations. Description: OWL 2 language provides a high level of expressivity. In the SEMIC interoperability context, the primary purpose of semantic artefacts is to establish the common set of concepts and how they are employed in data exchange. For this purpose, simple OWL 2 constructs suffice. Therefore, the OWL 2 ontology shall be kept lightweight, and no advanced logical definitions are necessary, which would make the ontology heavyweight. The Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, dedicated an entire section on the charm of weak semantics in the linked data world. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. We recommend the formal ontology definition be limited to the following types of expressions: class declarations (owl:Class, rdfs:Class) data property declarations (owl:DatatypeProperty, rdf:Property) object property declarations (owl:ObjectProperty, rdf:Property) subclass relations (rdfs:subClassOf) subproperty relations (rdfs:subPropertyOf) annotations concept labels (rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel, skos:altLabel) concept definitions (rdfs:comment, skos:definition, skos:scopeNote) notes and comments (rdfs:comment, skos:editorialNote, skos:changeNote, skos:historyNote, skos:example) ontology header with import statements (owl:import) version metadata (owl:versionInfo, owl:versionIRI) provenance metadata (e.g. dct:issued, adms:status) descriptive metadata The formal ontology shall not include other types of statements unless justified as necessary. The properties used, in particular those related to the ontology header, shall be aligned with the governance process. No expressions of (a) property domain specification (rdfs:domain) and (b) property range specification (rdfs:range) shall be used unless justified as absolutely necessary. The need for setting property domain and range constraints is better fulfilled by the data shapes expressed in SHACL language. Keeping the ontology lightweight allows the maximum freedom for reuse (e.g. in different application profiles, where domains/ranges can be specified or restricted), and does not interfere with the validation concerns covered by the data shapes. Note: This recommendation does not prevent the generation of more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity), as additional artefacts that would be included in the data specification. A data specification could even provide several such ontology versions, one for each OWL 2 profiles (EL/QL/RL), for example, if there are well-defined use cases identified for them. However, if such additional ontologies will be provided as part of the data specification, it is essential that they are all be kept consistent with all the other artefacts (including the lightweight ontology, the human-readable version, etc.) (see section on Transformation). Therefore, it is highly recommended having appropriate tool support, which enables the automatic generation of all the ontologies that are needed from the conceptual model. Regardless of how many ontology versions will be generated and published as part of the data specification, the most important thing, and hence the main point of this recommendation, is that there should always be at least one lightweight ontology, to support a highest level of interoperability and reuse. Often, this is called the \"core\" ontology, in data specifications that provide multiple ontology versions, while the other, more expressive, ontology versions have different names. Examples: For example, consider the (shortened) DCAT-AP imports header: rdf:type owl:Ontology ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports . Or consider, the (shortened) Core Person vocabulary header: a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; Title: Lexicalisation Identifier SC-R3 Statement: The choice in handling the lexicalisation of concepts shall be clearly defined and consistently implemented. Description: The lexicalisation of concepts in semantic artefacts can be implemented in multiple ways. Two popular approaches are used in practice: RDFS or SKOS lexicalisation. However, other types can be considered as well (e.g. [lemon], [vann], etc.). RDFS allows for a simple lexicalisation and annotation: labels rdfs:label may be used to provide a human-readable version of a resource’s name. comments rdfs:comment may be used to provide a human-readable description of a resource. SKOS offers a richer and more elaborate lexicalisation and annotation: Lexical labels skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel are useful when generating or creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organisation system. These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS concept. skos:hiddenLabel has a more technical nature and may be useful when a user is interacting with a knowledge organisation system via a text-based search function. The user may, for example, enter misspelled words when trying to find a relevant concept. Documentation properties skos:definition supplies a complete explanation of the intended meaning of a concept; skos:scopeNote supplies some, possibly partial, information about the intended meaning of a concept, especially as an indication of how the use of a concept is limited in indexing practice; skos:note useful for general documentation purposes; skos:example supplies an example of the use of a concept; skos:historyNote describes significant changes to the meaning or the form of a concept; skos:changeNote documents fine-grained changes to a concept, for the purposes of administration and maintenance; skos:editorialNote supplies information that is an aid to administrative housekeeping, such as reminders of editorial work still to be done, or warnings in the event that future editorial changes might be made. We recommend one, or the other is used. Both can be used at the same time without any consequence of semantics, but this will introduce redundancy and possibly a maintenance burden. Examples: For example, in Core Person Vocabulary RDFS lexicalisation is used: a rdf:Property; rdfs:label \"date of birth\"@en . For example in ePO, both lexicalisations are provided (even if this may be considered redundant): :Term a owl:Class ; rdfs:label \"Term\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; rdfs:isDefinedBy ; skos:definition \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; skos:prefLabel \"Term\"@en . Title: Reasoning assumption Identifier SC-R4 Statement: No reasoning capabilities shall be assumed. Description: OWL 2 constructs correspond to Description Logic (DL) concepts (direct semantics). Logic, besides expressing knowledge in a knowledge base, can be used to perform automated reasoning, i.e., inferring new knowledge based on premises and reasoning rules. The inference is also possible with RDF-based semantics, based on translating the axioms into directed graphs. The latter is used for SPARQL entailments and SHACL data shape rules. Automated reasoning is not consistently available across environments: small differences in the usage context or reasoning patterns may lead to different outcomes. Therefore, the editors of interoperable semantic data specifications are strongly recommended to NOT rely on such capabilities. Thus, in practice, the model shall allow for an explicit statement of the intended knowledge, and as little as possible shall be left implicit. Title: Circular definitions Identifier SC-R5 Statement: The data specification (semantic, conceptual, or shape) shall not use circular definitions. Description: Circular definition, i.e., definitions that use the element they define are incorrect. For instance, we say that an ontology element (a class, an object property or a data property) is circular when used in its own definition. This can occur in situations such as the following: (a) the definition of a class as the enumeration of several classes including itself; (b) the appearance of a class within its owl:equivalentClass or rdfs:subClassOf axioms; (c) the appearance of an object property in its rdfs:domain or rdfs:range definitions; or (d) the appearance of a data property in its rdfs:domain definition. Title: Data shape language choice Identifier DSC-R1 Statement: The data shapes shall be expressed in SHACL. Description: There are various languages allowing for data shape expression and thus define validation rules for RDF data. Among the executable ones, the most well-known are SHACL [shacl] and ShEx [shex]. We are aware that a strong community of practice exists for ShEx. However, as SHACL is a W3C standard, we strongly recommend using it. Title: Loose versus rigid constraints Identifier DSC-R2 Statement: In a Core Vocabulary, then the data shape constraints shall be as loose as possible, i.e., permissive, while in an Application Profile, the data shape constraints shall be as rigid as necessary, i.e. restrictive. Description: The Core Vocabularies are intended for a broad reuse and are concerned with establishing the concepts. This is addressed by the ontology artefact. Optionally it may be accompanied by a minimal set of data shape constraints expressing general domain limitations. For example, it may be already defined in the Core Vocabulary that a class cannot be instantiated without certain mandatory properties or that a declared property shall be used only with values from a pre-established controlled vocabulary. If a data shape artefact is provided, then any Application Profile reusing the Core Vocabulary shall not only import the ontology, but the data shapes as well. The Application Profiles are usually intended for narrower use cases and mostly are concerned with setting restrictions on the way reused vocabulary ought to be used. It is a good practice to make such restrictions as restrictive as necessary but still provide space for variation as it typically occurs in practice. This is even more important when an Application Profile is conceived as reusable in other Application Profiles. Examples: Consider DCAT-AP, for example. It is an Application Profile on top of the DCAT vocabulary, but other more specific Application Profiles are still created on top of it (e.g., DCAT-AP CH, DCAT-AP DE, DCAT-AP NO, etc.) Title: Open and Closed world assumptions Identifier DSC-R3 Statement: The data instantiating a core model may be fragmented across information systems. For representation purposes, open-world assumptions shall be adopted, and for validation purposes, a closed-world assumption shall be adopted. Description: Operations on the data, such as automated reasoning and validation, are impacted by what is assumed about its completeness. If it is considered complete, then we say that we operate under the closed-world assumption; otherwise, in the cases of continually evolving and distributed data (that is more in line with reality), the data is considered possibly incomplete, and we say that operating is under the open-world assumption. Under the closed-world assumption, it is presumed that a true statement is also known to be true. Therefore, conversely, what is not currently known to be true, is false [reiter81]. The opposite of the closed-world assumption is the open-world assumption stating that lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. The truth value of a statement may be true despite whether or not it is known to be true. This means that when validating, the data must be considered complete to assess whether it fulfils the imposed constraints or recommended shapes. Therefore, everything that is not known to be true must be considered false. This may have an impact, especially for larger vocabularies (such as the eProcurement ontology), on how the data shapes are organised. As data shapes may be used to suggest how the data may be fragmented and how it shall not. Title: Shape definitions Identifier DSC-R4 Statement: Each ontology class shall be mirrored by a sh:NodeShape. The property constraints may be embedded (contextualised) within node shapes or defined as freestanding. Description: When generating SHACL shapes, it is a good practice to create a node shape for each class in the Conceptual Model and, within it, a property shape for each property of that class. If the property shapes are defined within the node shapes (rather than freestanding), then we mirror the structure depicted in the Conceptual Model. Doing so is intuitive for the readers, the resulting constraint definitions are organically integrated, and the maintenance costs are decreased. However, sometimes it may be useful to define the property shapes as freestanding, therefore making them reusable independent of the node shape context. Freestanding property shapes are universal constraints on the property. They apply to all usages, in all possible data exchanges. Therefore, their use should be limited to those cases that support the broadest reuse context, and do not encode a specific application usage context. As such, freestanding property shapes play more a role in the validation of the correct usage of the property in an application context, rather than in the correct data exchange. The above considerations do not exclude that property shapes used within a node shape could be named with a unique URI, through the reuse of which a coherent network of constraints can be facilitated. The shapes shall be created in a separate namespace in order to allow dereferencing to either OWL 2 or SHACL definitions. In some communities, the URIs used in the OWL 2 specifications are reused in SHACL. The class definitions are extended as node shapes. In SHACL semantics, this is interpreted as an equivalent to specifying a sh:targetNode class. This approach allows the use of a single reference in both the ontology and data shape definition yet specifies separate concerns in separate artefacts. The advantage of the approach is increased consistency and readability while maintenance costs decrease. Yet, this approach does not allow for dereferencing separately OWL 2 or SHACL representations. Hence, it is recommended to avoid such practice. Title: Data shape severity Identifier DSC-R5 Statement: It is recommended to use constraint severity for distinguishing critical violations from non-critical recommendation warnings and from nice-to-have information. Description: Data shapes can be assigned a level of severity. The specific values of severity have no impact on the validation but may be used by user interface tools to categorise validation results. The severity levels are: Info - A non-critical constraint violation indicating an informative message. Warning - A non-critical constraint violation indicating a warning. Violation - A constraint violation. Title: 5-star Linked Open Data Identifier PC-R1 Statement: Publishing data specifications shall be compliant with 5-star LOD criteria. Description: Publishing a vocabulary as a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource means making it accessible, both human and machine-readable, in a standard way, thus supporting the semantic web. The publication as full LOD implies that the data is compliant with the highest grade of 5-Star [5star-od] open data evaluation: The data is available on the Web under an open licence The data is available following a clear structure The data is available using a non-proprietary open format The data uses URIs to denote concepts The data is linked to other resources to provide context On the same note, the FAIR Data Principles [fair-principles] is a more comprehensive and rich set of guidelines for publishing data on the web. They ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data, as a result of the increase in volume, complexity and creation speed of data [fair-guidelines]. See more [ dwbp, ld-bp, ldp-bp ] Title: Persistent URI policy Identifier PC-R2 Statement: The URIs that are used to identify the terms modelled in the data specifications should be dereferenceable Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] and comply with a URI policy (or URI strategy). URIs that are well-defined according to such criteria are often denoted as PURIs [10rules-puri]. SEMIC adheres to the EU persistent URI policy. Each SEMIC URI is dereferenceable in both machine representation (RDF artefacts) and human-readable (HTML artefact). Description: When publishing data on the web [dwdp], it is crucial to have a structured and persistent system of URIs in place. Such URIs make it easy for the users to understand the vocabulary structure and retrieve information as they expect. The 10 rules for Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] are base principles for the design of quality identifiers. Regarding URI design, the main consideration of creators should be that when a URI is created, all its parts should be resistant to change. For instance, locations and organisation names can change and therefore should not be used in URIs. First and foremost, when introducing semantics in URIs, the strings used need to reflect what the resources are (i.e. intrinsic characteristics such as the type or nature), not who owns them or where they are [uri-dp]. In 2014, the ISA Programme devised a common policy for managing persistent HTTP-based URIs of EU institutions [uri-dp, 10rules-puri, puri-gov-eu]. That has led to an EU wide URI resolution service, prescribing that each URI is of the following pattern: http://data.europa.eu/{Collection}/{Reference} The {Collection} is an organisation-agnostic name for a collection of terms. Within a {Collection} the local names, or references, are being maintained according to the policy of the {Collection}. For SEMIC data specifications, the names are dependent on the naming conventions mentioned in this style guide rules [GC-R4 + CMC-R3]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, ] Examples: For example, the PURIs defined within the SEMIC Core Vocabularies are all within the {Collection} m8g. And thus the term Evidence in the context of CCCEV is denoted with the PURI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/Evidence. Title: Version management Identifier PC-R3 Statement: A consistent version management shall be implemented for the data specification evolution respecting the \"semantic versioning\" principles. Description: The SEMIC versioning methodology is based on \"semantic versioning\" principles [sem-ver] and implements a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. It involves describing clearly and precisely what is being published and which features are included, and what the limitations are, setting the expectations and scope. Once the artefacts are identified for the public, the changes to the data specifications are communicated with specific increments to the version number and with associated change notes. The version format is X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). As a rule of thumb, bug fixes do not affect the artefact and increment the Patch version. Backwards compatible artefact additions/changes increment the Minor version. And, backwards-incompatible artefact changes increment the Major version. Examples: For example, evolving from version 1.3.5 to 1.3.6 represents a backwards-compatible patch, from 1.3.5 to 1.4.0, a backwards-compatible new development, while switching from 1.3.5 to 2.0.0 breaks the backwards compatibility. Title: Artefact versioning Identifier PC-R4 Statement: The data specification shall be versioned as a whole and never to atomic elements (concepts, relations or constraints). Description: Create a new version with each publication. Using the semantic version principles to determine the exact version number depends on whether it is a major, minor or patch update. The version shall be assigned to the entire vocabulary or Application Profile and never to elements in the model (concepts, relations, constraints, etc.) [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.6]. The version shall be saved as the model metadata (for example, in the owl:Ontology header). No version information shall be embedded into any artefact URIs unless it is a version URI provided via owl:versionIRI. Title: URI dereferencing Identifier PC-R5 Statement: Any URI identifiable resource devised in a data specification shall be dereferenceable. Description: Dereferencing means that one can use the URI as an URL to retrieve related information back. The format and representation in which the information is returned depend on content negotiation. Content negotiation is the interaction between the client application and the server in which the client informs the server about its preferred format and representation and the server responds with the best-fitting result it can provide. It is recommended to provide (format) content negotiation for HTTP which is based on the interpretation of the Accept: HTTP header. The dereferencing shall be provided for both human-readable and machine-readable formats. A human-aimed HTML representation is the default response (if no content type is specified), and the other is RDF [10rules-puri]. Because the HTML representation is usally a long document, which makes it hard to find the information about a specific term, it is recommended that the HTML representation has landing points based on the used fragment identifier. Dereferencing can then route the reader to the most relevant information within the HTML document. For other representations/formats no additional requirements are imposed. For example, the dereferencing in the RDF representation, depends on the implemented recipe, i.e. based on # or /; and it may return either the corresponding fragment or the whole RDF document [pub-recipe]. Further technical details can be found in \"Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies\" [rdf-pub]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp ] Title: Human-readable form Identifier PC-R6 Statement: Each data specification shall have a corresponding human-readable form representing the model documentation. Description: The documentation content shall follow a standard template for consistent formatting and content structuring. It is a good practice to provide the following sections in the document: Preamble with metadata indicating Title Abstract Date of publication/release Version information Authors, editors, contributors Licensing information Introduction describing the Background information Context & Scope Intended audience UML diagrams of the model Description of each element in the model grouped by element type (e.g. class, property, constraint, controlled vocabulary). Each element shall be described by its URI and its Lexicalisation: URI (shall be clearly visible) Labels (preferred and alternative) Definitions, scope notes, examples, editorial notes, etc. Moreover, consider following the good practices for documenting OWL 2 and SHACL artefacts, and include the appropriate details in the data specification documentation. For OWL 2, we can mention tools like Widoco [widoco] and LODE [lode]; and for SHACL, follow the SHACL recommendation [shacl], or the metadata support implemented in tools such as SHACL-play [shacl-play]. For application profiles, consider aligning to the DCAP [dcap], which is an implementation agnostic recommendation. Title: Short reference to the rule Identifier The acronym used to reference the rule in this document. Statement: Each rule should be stated in a simple sentence. Description: Optionally, a rule may have a more elaborate description of how to apply, when to apply it, why it is useful, and what is its scope. Or it can be optionally answering questions such as: What is the rationale? Why is the rule useful? What are the benefits of applying this rule? What are the constraints or limitations? What implications does this rule have in practice (e.g. requirements for applying)? When to apply it? How to apply it? To what exceptions to pay attention? The description should be 1-2 paragraphs at most. Examples: Optionally, a rule may have some examples of where it applies and how it is manifested.

There are semantic data specifications. They comprise nothing else but a collection of terms, structure and rule specifications on how to combine these terms and (RE)use expectations. In the SEMIC context, a semantic data specification can be either: a Core Vocabulary, or an Application Profile There are Artefacts. They encode or indicate a representation format, attend a need or specific purpose, and address a clear concern. In the SEMIC context, we acknowledge, but not limited to, the following list of artefacts: Persistent URIs OWL 2 representation SHACL representation HTML representation Pictures/Diagrams UML representation JSON-LD representation (+ JSON schema) XML representation (+ XSD schema) …​ Note that not all artefacts are treated in the current style-guide, but only the ones that are in scope of the Semantic Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif]. Definition A conceptual model, also referred to as conceptual model specification, is an abstract representation of a system and comprises well-defined concepts, their qualities or attributes, and their relationships to other concepts. A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. Description A conceptual model is a representation of a system that uses concepts to form said representation. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well named by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. The conceptual model comprises representations of concepts, their qualities or attributes and relationships to other concepts. Most commonly, these are association and generalisation relations. In addition, the conceptual model can be materialised in a graphical representation facilitating knowledge elicitation, organisation and interaction with domain experts. This is relevant because interactions and discussions within a Working Group for a data specification are often driven by a graphical representation. However, the need for a conceptual model and a visual representation shall not be conflated. Thus, we keep clear separation of concerns, which is addressed in detailed in the next section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. There is no perfect candidate for representing the conceptual model. And, although not without limitations, risks for misunderstandings and mis-interpretations, we choose (a subset of) UML language [epo-cm2owl] as most appropriate and instrumental in addressing (a) the concern for having a conceptual model established and (b) the concern for providing a graphical representation. The UML appropriateness has been acknowledged based on a longstanding experience and practices. An entire section of this style guide is dedicated to (UML) conceptual model [see Conceptual model conventions]. The subset of the UML language considered in this style guide is comprised (but not limited to) in the following set of UML elements: Class Class Attribute Connector Association Dependency Generalisation Enumeration For visual representation only UML Class Diagrams are considered. Note: UML will be the recommended language for defining the conceptual models until a better and more appropriate alternative with robust tool support is developed, that is also addressing the SEMIC methods and practices [see Architectural clarification]. Definition An ontology, also referred to as ontology specification, is a a formal specification describing the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents (e.g. domain experts) [gruber93]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse [wiki-onto]. Description The ontology constitutes the formal (machine-readable) definition of concepts. Although the languages for expressing ontologies vary in expressivity, we shall keep it light and simple, from the formal point of view, with minimal detail and level of expressivity [SC-R2]. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. In the SEMIC context, we only consider lightweight ontologies [defined in rule SC-R2]. Therefore, even if this aspect is not emphasised as \"lightweight ontology\", it is implicitly meant even when simple \"ontology\" reference is used. We assume that the ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language [SC-R1]. The main purpose of this component is to declare the classes, properties, datatypes and controlled lists. Each construct is established by assigning a URI and decorating it with human-readable labels and descriptions, and constitutes the mechanism to establish common references for humans and machines. Definition A data shape specification, also referred to as data shape constraint specification, or simply as data shape constraint or data shape, provides a set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated. Description The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language. This document will refer to data shape constraint specifications simply as \"data shapes\", but occasionally also as \"data shape constraints\" or \"data shape specifications\". Definition A data specification document, also referred to as specification document, is the human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape, or a combination of both. Description A data specification document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to understand (a) how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain, and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose. It is to serve as technical documentation for anyone interested in using (e.g. adopting or extending) a semantic data specification (see [What is a semantic data specification?]). We assume that the data specification documents are published in HTML format (optionally, others). See, for example, the Core Person specification [cpv] or the CPSV-AP specification [cpsv-ap]. Definition A data specification artefact, often referred to as specification artefact or simply artefact, is a materialisation of a semantic data specification in a concrete representation that is appropriate for addressing one or more concerns (e.g. use cases, requirements). Description In the SEMIC context, we consider the following artefact types as primary: ontologies, data shapes, and specification documents. For a description of various concerns addressed in the SEMIC context, please see the section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. Additionally, we are concerned with syntax bindings and serialisation formats (XML/XSD and JSON-LD in particular). Still, these are not in the scope of this document and are addressed elsewhere. For more, see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. Definition A semantic data specification , often called simply data specification, is a union of machine- and human-readable artefacts addressing clearly defined concerns, interoperability scope and use-cases. A semantic data specification comprises at least an ontology and a data shape (or either of them individually) accompanied by a human-readable data specification. Description One general categorisation of semantic data specifications is along the reuse axis. Some semantic data specifications are built with the intent that the terms of the conceptual model can be used in as much as possible contexts. Typically, it is possible to use the terms independently of each other. In this case, the definitions of the terms are usually very broad and abstract, and only the bare minimum of (usage) constraints are expressed. Often, the terms are presented as a list to the reader, with identifiers for each term in the same namespace. Those semantic data specifications are usually denoted with terms such as vocabularies or terminology. On the other side of the spectrum are the data specifications that precisely encode the semantics of the conceptual model that is being used in a single data exchange context, implemented in software or API. They usually have a strong connection with technical data representations (see section on [Technical artefacts and concerns]) and documentations such as XSD schema, OpenAPI specifications, etc. Conceptual models for this purpose will contain precise constraints, technical datatypes, the code-lists that are being used, refer to implementation decisions, etc. Semantic data specifications that are created for that purpose are denoted with Implementation Models. As that name indicate, their objective is to encode the conceptual model of an implementation. Between those two extremes, i.e. contextfree reuse (vocabularies) and unique usage context (Implementation Models), there are semantic data specifications that aim to capture the conceptual model for a broad, yet well-defined, usage context. Typically, these data specifications do not intend to introduce new terms in the conceptual model, but will exploit terms from other semantic data specifications. These exploited terms are augmented with additional usage constraints making the terms more fit for purpose. These semantic data specifications are often denoted with terms such as Application Profiles or Profiles. Readers should understand that the usage relationships between semantic data specifications form a complex network. An attempt to provide a structured view on this network was initiated in the draft W3C Profile Guide [profile-guide]. Also, the Application Profiles do not necessarily have to address all the technical needs related to an implemented system. Distinction between technical and semantic interoperability layers is attempted in this section. This categorisation along the reuse axis indicates the importance of expressing the interoperability scope for semantic data specifications. However, due to the absence of widely accepted definitions for those categories, outlining the exact Dos and Don’ts (for each category), may result to different expectations for each category. This style guide is a document that defines the commonly accepted and applied rules for SEMIC. In the SEMIC context, two types of semantic data specifications are considered: [Core Vocabulary] and [Application Profile]. Semantic data specifications of the third category, Implementation Models, are not part of the activities of SEMIC. Nevertheless, their existence, is taken into account when building the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. Occasionally, this document will refer to semantic data specifications shortly as \"data specifications\". With a similar meaning, the term \"semantic asset\" is used in the literature (e.g. ADMS [adms]). However, in our understanding, the term \"semantic asset\" is broader than \"data specification\" and includes controlled vocabularies and possibly other types of assets. Definition A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable and extensible data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context. Broad context (on vocabularies) On the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as \"terms\") used to describe and represent an area of concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular application, characterise possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only) [vocab]. There is no clear division between what is referred to as \"vocabulary\" and \"ontology\". The trend is to use the word \"ontology\" for a more complex and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas \"vocabulary\" is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or used only in a very loose sense [vocab]. SEMIC context (on Core Vocabularies) Formally, a Core Vocabulary encompasses a lightweight ontology, and, optionally, a (permissive) data shape specification, and it is expressed in a condensed, comprehensive data specification document. CV = lightweight ontology + (optionally) a (permissive) data shape For more details see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. The qualifications lightweight and permissive are used to better emphasise the intention to be reused in the broadest possible context. More precise boundaries are defined further in this document. NOTE: \"Vocabularies\", in general, are not the same as \"controlled vocabularies\", as the latter usually refers to SKOS artefacts. However, in other contexts (similar to SEMIC), a Core Vocabulary might often be simply denoted as \"vocabulary\". Definition An Application Profile is a data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context. It re-uses concepts from one or more semantic data specifications, while adding more specificity, by identifying mandatory, recommended, and optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and providing recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used [dcat-ap]. Description An Application Profile (AP) is a data shape specification which addresses particular application needs (operating within some domain or community) while providing semantic interoperability with other applications based on one or more shared ontologies (vocabularies) [dc-ap]. Formally, the Application Profile encompasses (a) reused ontology specifications (one or many) and (b) its own data shape specification. Optionally it may include (c) reused data shape specifications (one or many), and (d) it may provide its own ontology specification to fill the ontological gaps. AP = reused lightweight ontology + own data shape + (optionally) reused (permissive) data shape + (optionally) own ontology SEMIC context In SEMIC, Application Profiles encompass an ontology, which is largely composed of importing the reused ontologies, complemented with an appropriate data shape specification. Terms that are introduced because of the Application Profile needs are, by preference, added to existing Core Vocabularies. If this is not possible, an Application Profile-specific Vocabulary is created. AP = reused Core Vocabulary + own data shape + (optionally) own ontology The data specification document of an Application Profile is elaborated. It provides the application scope and context, and documents the ontology and the data shapes through the conceptual model. It also provides additional information that stimulates the adoption and correct usage of the AP in implementations.","title":"Terminological clarifications","component":"style-guide","version":"develop","name":"terminological-clarifications","url":"/style-guide/develop/terminological-clarifications.html","titles":[{"text":"What is a conceptual model?","hash":"sec:what-is-a-conceptual-model","id":1},{"text":"What is an ontology?","hash":"sec:what-is-an-ontology","id":2},{"text":"What is a data shape specification?","hash":"sec:what-is-a-data-shape-contraint","id":3},{"text":"What is a data specification document?","hash":"sec:what-is-a-specification-document","id":4},{"text":"What is a data specification artefact?","hash":"sec:what-is-an-artefact","id":5},{"text":"What is a semantic data specification?","hash":"sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification","id":6},{"text":"What is a Core Vocabulary (CV) specification?","hash":"sec:what-is-a-cv-specification","id":7},{"text":"What is an Application Profile (AP) specification?","hash":"sec:what-is-an-ap-specification","id":8}]},"60":{"id":60,"text":"XMI [http://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/] The XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is an Object Management Group (OMG) standard for exchanging metadata information via Extensible Markup Language (XML).

Understanding this framework allows stakeholders to use the semantic data specifications effectively and align expectations and practices ensuring consistent and effective communication. The structure of the section is methodically organised into several subsections, each focusing on a different element of semantic data specifications. It begins with a broad overview of the specifications, and establishes what the artefacts are. Then progressively it narrows down to specific artefacts types, namely data models and documentation. Further subsections explore data models interaction across different layers of data interoperability, and semantic data specification types. This sequential approach helps readers build a comprehensive understanding from general concepts to specific explanations. Semantic data specifications are composite standards designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability among diverse systems, characterised by their descriptive and prescriptive nature. These specifications are realised through a suite of artefacts that are harmoniously interrelated and address different interoperability scopes and use cases—ranging from semantic to technical concerns. The artefacts are fashioned to be both machine-readable and human-understandable, ensuring consistent interpretation and utilisation. Figure 1 depicts a conceptualisation of how various components that make up a complete semantic data specification interconnect. At the top of the diagram is the \"Semantic data specification\" indicating its overarching role. It serves a \"Purpose/Goal\" which frames various specific \"Concern/Need\". The semantic data specification comprises various \"Artefacts\" denoting the different elements that make up the specification. Figure 1 Beneath this, the framework branches into two main types of artefacts: \"Data models” and \"Documentation\". The most relevant data models are \"Vocabulary\", \"Ontology\", \"Data shape\" and \"UML Class model\". Each data model is expressed in a \"Modelling language\" appropriate for the concern or the need addressed. The next section introduces the relevant artefact types. Integral to semantic data specifications is the intrinsic consistency and coherence among the artefacts. Each represents a facet of the same domain knowledge, but is tailored to address specific concerns—such as human understandability, semantic underpinning, formal definition, and data serialisation (addressed in the next section). This alignment ensures that each artefact, while distinct in function, contributes to a unified view of the domain, making the entire specification accessible and actionable. Such consistency is pivotal in maintaining semantic integrity, leading to robust technical interoperability and seamless information exchange. Each artefact, while unique in its form and function, represents different facets of the same domain. They are harmonised, yet distinct, with each created to address specific concerns, such as: Semantic Underpinning: The semantic data specification needs to encapsulate formally the domain knowledge, capturing the essence of its concepts and the possible relationships between them. Ontologies play a key role here, offering a structured and logical framework that lays out the domain knowledge in a way that is both comprehensive and actionable. Formal Definition: Using formal languages such as OWL or RDFS for semantic representation enables precise interpretation and inference over the ontologies and instance data. Moreover, data shapes facilitate data structuring on top of the ontology, defining precise constraints and conditions under which the data can be instantiated. This formalisation ensures that the data adheres to the standard, facilitating automated validation and processing. Human Understandability: This aspect ensures that individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, can comprehend and engage with the semantic data specifications. The reference documentation along with visual representation of UML class diagrams brings clarity and guidance for human users to grasp the meaning of the semantic data specification and its intended use. Visual Representation: The semantic data specification is much easier to understand once it is presented in a visual format. Typically class diagrams are the most suitable to encapsulate the concepts and the relations between boosting significantly comprehension. Data Serialisation: The technical artefacts of the specification, such as information exchange data models for various serialisation formats (e.g., JSON-LD, XML), ensure that the data can be correctly serialised, deserialized, and exchanged across systems and platforms. They cater for the technical requirements of data transport (and storage). The coherence among these artefacts ensures that despite their different purposes and audiences, they all align in their representation of the domain knowledge. This alignment guarantees that whether a stakeholder is interpreting the model conceptually, engaging with it through documentation, or implementing it technically, they are presented with a unified and consistent view of the semantic data specification. This cohesive approach is pivotal for maintaining semantic integrity across various applications and systems. The key data model artefacts of a specification include: Vocabulary: An established list of preferred terms that signify concepts or relationships within a domain of discourse. All terms must have an unambiguous and non-redundant definition. Optionally it may include synonyms, notes and their translation to multiple languages. It is represented informally, for example, as a spreadsheet or SKOS thesaurus. Ontology: An ontology is a formal, machine-readable specification of a conceptual model [Harpring2016]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming using URIs, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse, effectively enabling a shared and common understanding of data [wiki-onto]. It is usually expressed in OWL and RDFS. Data Shape: Constraints or patterns that describe how instantiations of an ontology should be structured. Data shape artefacts can be used not only to ensure that RDF data adheres to predefined structure and validation rules, but also as a blueprint for information exchange data models, preserving semantics and ensuring consistency in data exchange. It is usually expressed in SHACL. Controlled list (of values): A value vocabulary used to express concepts or values in instance data. It defines resources (such as instances of topics, languages, countries, or authors) that are used as values for elements in metadata records. Typically, the value vocabularies serve as reference data and constitute \"building blocks\" with which metadata records can be populated. UML class model: A static structure UML model and associated diagrams that describes the structure of data by showing the classes, their attributes, and the relationships among objects. It may include documentation, description and various annotations. Such data model shall be conformant to the SEMIC style guide in order to fit for purpose of semantic data specifications. Human-readable documentation: This artefact elucidates the specifications for stakeholders of varying business and technical backgrounds, detailing the structure, intent, and practical application of the semantic data specification. Beyond these foundational elements, semantic data specifications may also incorporate artefacts designed for the technical interoperability layer called information exchange data models. They define and describe in a technology-specific manner the structure and content of information that is exchanged between organisations in a specific information exchange context. They detail the syntax, structure, data types, and constraints necessary for effective data communication between systems. These artefacts are necessary to realise the technical interoperability. If the chosen technology for exchange is of semantic nature (e.g. RDF), then a perfect syntax-semantics conflation is readily available through ontologies and data shapes. Otherwise, if a more traditional technology is selected due to popularity or legacy reasons, such as XML/XSD or JSON, then a mapping that acts as a syntax-semantics interface needs to be established, binding the physical model and the semantic specification. These can include various information exchange data models like: JSON-LD context definitions: Facilitating the mapping of JSON to RDF linked data representation. XML Schemas (XSD): Defining the structure and validating the constraints of XML documents. API (Component) Specifications (REST, WSDL or GraphQL): Outlining the request, response and parameters for web-based data access and manipulation [swagger]. Such components are generally reusable blocks to facilitate reusability and maintenance of APIs. In the framework depicted [below], the artefacts are strategically organised within the semantic and technical interoperability layers, with each layer focusing on different but complementary aspects of data interoperability. As it can be seen, some artefacts belong to the semantic layer, and others to the technical layer, while the data shapes are present in both, according to their multipurpose nature. The Semantic Layer encapsulates artefacts associated with the conceptual understanding of data. It is focused on defining the vocabulary and ontology that provide the foundational elements for data interoperability. These artefacts ensure that the meaning of data is clearly defined and shared across different systems, establishing the semantic rules that govern data exchange. The Technical Layer is concerned with the practical aspects of data handling, such as data representation formats, communication protocols, and interface specifications. Artefacts in this layer address the technical requirements necessary for data to be physically exchanged and processed by information systems. Documentation and UML Class models are depicted as orthogonal to these layers, as they facilitate human understanding and transcend the semantic-technical divide. These artefacts provide clarity and guidance, helping stakeholders visualise and comprehend the data structures and relationships without being confined to the constraints of either layer. We can discern three interconnected layers each representing a different level of abstraction in semantic data specifications. The arrangement signifies the gradation from the abstract to the specific. The Upper Layer accommodates the most abstract form of semantic data specifications. These specifications are context-free, meaning that they are not tied to any particular domain or application, and can be universally applied across various fields. These semantic data specifications, provide the broadest concepts that can be reused in numerous contexts. Here we generally find upper level ontologies (defining highly abstract foundational concepts such as “object”, “property”, “event” etc.), but also the core semantic data specifications, which, although more specific, can also be applied across multiple domains. The main objective of the Core Vocabularies is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context [sem-sg-wsds]. Upper ontologies and core semantic data specifications serve as a scaffolding for domain ontologies, offering a hierarchy where the more general terms of the upper ontology act as superclasses (in some cases even as metaclasses) to the more specific classes of domain ontologies. This arrangement supports the structuring and integration of knowledge by providing common reference points that enhance understanding and data processing across different systems. Notable examples: Upper ontologies: DOLCE, Gist, BFO, etc. Core Vocabularies: Dublin Core Terms, Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), The Organization Ontology (ORG), European Legislation Identifier (ELI) The Domain Layer sits at the intersection of the upper and application layers. It contains specifications that are more specific than the upper layer, but not as narrowly focused as the application layer. The semantic data specifications in this layer incorporate concepts relevant to a domain or sector (e.g. the justice domain, the public procurement domain, the healthcare domain) and represent the most specific knowledge from the perspective of that domain. The domain layer is visually overlapped by both the upper and application layers, symbolising that some domain-specific semantic data specifications can inherit traits from, or lend characteristics to, both the more abstract upper layer and the more concrete application layer. Notable examples: DCAT-AP eProcurement Ontology The Application Layer is the most concrete and context-specific, containing semantic data specifications tailored for particular applications or families of applications. Application Profiles are detailed in constraints and data shapes, addressing explicit needs and constraints of a specific system or use case, and generally provide precise technical artefacts that can be used in data exchange. Notable examples: GeoDCAT-AP BRegDCAT-AP Stat-DCAT-AP Terminological Clarification: The level of abstraction pertaining to a semantic data specification—be it core, domain, or application—can be applied as an adjective to describe its constituent artefacts. Thus, for a \"core semantic data specification\" the included components would be referred to as \"core vocabulary\", \"core ontology\", \"core data shape\" and \"core exchange data model\" and so on. Similarly, for a \"domain semantic data specification,\" the elements would be denoted as \"domain vocabulary\", \"domain ontology\", \"domain data shape\" and \"domain exchange data model\", respectively. In the semantic data specification framework depicted [below], the documentation artefacts are organised into three distinct types, as illustrated in Figure 2, each catering to different aspects of user engagement with the data model. For effective documentation practices, we recommend principles laid out in the Diátaxis framework, which is a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users [dtx]. It identifies four distinct needs (learning, understanding, consulting reference, achieving goals), and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, handbooks, reference documentation and textbooks. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs. In addition, we mention the Diagrams, which are usually embedded into documents, to underline the importance of visual depiction of models and to recognise them as distinct artefacts from the models (e.g. UML class diagrams). In the context of semantic data specifications we find relevant the following documentation kinds. Figure 2 The Handbook (or usage manual) is a how-to guide and serves as an introductory reading to users new to the semantic data specification. It can also take the form of a tutorial to achieve predefined goals. It typically comprises use-case descriptions, examples and practical, step-by-step instructions designed to help users acquire the necessary skills to effectively use the semantic data specification. Examples: This document The Textbook (or explanatory manual) is an explanatory type of documentation and focuses on deepening the users’ understanding of the underlying concepts and principles incorporated into the semantic data specification. It aims to inform cognition, enhancing the user’s theoretical knowledge and conceptual insight, which is critical for those looking to gain a more profound grasp of the specification’s rationale, decisions, strengths and limitations. Examples: SEMIC Style Guide [sem-sg] The Reference document is a technical type of documentation and provides concise, detailed information about various elements of the semantic data specification. It serves users who are already familiar with the theoretical framework and need to apply their knowledge to specific tasks. This artefact is a go-to resource for factual and objective data about the semantic specifications, such as semantics, syntax, entities, properties, relationships, and constraints within the data model. Examples: reference documents for Core Person [cpv], Core Business [cbv], etc. These documentation artefacts are designed to collectively support the user’s journey from novice to expert within the semantic data specification domain. The Usage Manual aids in initial skill acquisition, the Explanatory Textbook supports deeper learning and understanding, and the Reference Documentation acts as a reliable resource for informed application and use. Together, they ensure that users at different stages of learning and practice have access to the appropriate materials to meet their needs.","title":"","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"Conceptual-framework","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/Conceptual-framework.html","titles":[{"text":"Conceptual framework","hash":"_conceptual_framework","id":1},{"text":"Semantic data specifications","hash":"sec:semantic-data-specifications","id":2},{"text":"Artefacts","hash":"sec:artefacts","id":3},{"text":"Data models","hash":"sec:data-models","id":4},{"text":"Artefacts across interoperability layers","hash":"sec:artefacts-across-interoperability-layers","id":5},{"text":"Data specification types","hash":"sec:data-specification-types","id":6},{"text":"Documentation","hash":"sec:documentation","id":7}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"The consumers of SEMIC standards specification can be divided into three categories: business users and domain experts, technicians, software engineers, and software architects, the developers software systems implementing the standards, the machines The SEMIC goal is to bring these groups together, help them \"speak the same language\" and share meaning and conceptual references. Besides the very useful and much needed alignment of domains experts on what concepts mean, it is necessary to bridge the gap between domain experts and the technical experts who implement information systems. Then, the domain experts and business users shall interact with the information systems using the very same set of concepts, agnostic to and undistorted by the technology in the implementation process. Standard semantic data specifications fulfil the purpose keeping these three groups in sync. Ultimately, if the systems are based on standards the purpose is to build interoperable machines - machines that share data with each other and are able to operate on them seamlessly. The developers implement those machine interactions, and therefore the machines and developers must \"find a common language\". However, in order to ensure that the developers take the appropriate steps, the business/domain experts have to interact with them and convey their domain knowledge. This closes the loop: that the machine interactions correspond with the business/domain expert expectations. The data specification shall address the following information needs: visual representation, textual description, machine interpretable representation, and optionally additional representations that facilitate and promote adoption. The aim of this style guide is to ensure the creation of coherent data specifications that can be read and used by domain experts, developers and machines. It is mainly meant for the editors of the data specifications (e.g. semantic engineers, data architects, knowledge modelling specialists). Such data specifications are primarily developed in collaboration with domain experts. To achieve synergy with the domain experts, graphical representation is an indispensable medium that facilitates knowledge elicitation, ideation and knowledge organisation. This becomes especially relevant when shared conceptualisation needs to be attained within a Working Group. The successful application of an ontology or the development of an ontology-based system depends not merely on building a good ontology but also on fitting this into an appropriate development process and implementation into an information system. Generally, computing information models suffer from the intertwining of two types of semantic concerns. As George Box said, \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\", and what a model is useful for depends on what concern it is primarily addressing. On the one hand, the model represents (purely) the domain; on the other hand, it represents the implemented system, which encompasses a representation of the domain (domain knowledge intertwined with technical specificities). These different representation requirements place different demands upon its structure [partridge13]. For example, the concept of \"location\" can be described by domain experts (in a domain model) in a way that is not isomorphic to how the \"location\" class may be appropriately modelled for an information system (i.e., captured in an Implementation Model). One of the common ways to manage this problem is by separating concerns. We take inspiration from OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [mda], which is a well-documented structure where a model is built for each concern, which is transformed into a different model for a different concern. This approach is adapted to the SEMIC needs. Transformation deals with producing different models, viewpoints, or artefacts from a model based on a transformation pattern. In general, transformation can produce one representation from another or cross levels of abstraction or architectural layers [mda-guide]. The Core Vocabularies (CVs) and the specialised Application Profiles (APs) aim to address the following concerns: Domain experts need to agree on the definitions of concepts, relations and their organisation to form a coherent domain model expressed with varying levels of details and expressivity [SC-R2], a shared conceptualisation. This is addressed with conceptual models expressed in UML. The shared conceptualisation needs to be explicitly represented in a usable format (i.e. operated on) by the machines. This is addressed with lightweight ontologies expressed in OWL 2. In practice, to achieve interoperability, it is necessary to provide a (minimum and necessary) set of constraints supporting the ontology instantiation. This is addressed with data shapes expressed in SHACL. To facilitate reuse and understanding, a specification shall be accessible to the community as clear, complete and well-articulated documentation. This is addressed with data specification documents expressed in HTML. In addition, when multiple artefacts addressing each concern are produced, keeping them in synch is a serious editorial and maintenance burden that needs to be considered. On the editorial side the artefacts composing a data specification need to be kept in sync. A modification done in one shall pervade and propagate in all others. This is a difficult, tedious and expensive activity if such synchronisation is to be done manually. Experience shows that using a pivot representation as a single source of truth is a viable solution. Such representation needs to be expressive enough to fulfill all the information needs of the derived artefacts. UML conceptual models can be used as the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. This means it is sufficiently expressive to capture multiple modelling aspects/concerns simultaneously. The other artefacts are then fully or partially derived from the conceptual model. With UML as the single source of truth, the update process is easier to perform as it only has to be done in a single place. The other representations are automatically derived from the conceptual model; the maintenance is less error-prone, uniform and easy [Transformation]. This approach facilitates consistent maintenance of semantic data specification interrelationship and solves the editorial synchronisation problem. However, using UML is not enough, by itself, as the risk of ambiguity and multiple interpretations of the meaning of the UML model elements used in the conceptual model still exists. This risk is mitigated by adopting precise interpretation rules, such as the ones provided in this style guide [CMC-R2]. The different concerns that each data specification is trying to address might lead to different interpretations of the same UML constructs. Therefore, [CMC-R2] defines only a minimal set of such interpretation rules (that can be further extended, if necessary). Additionally, UML cannot cover all potential needs specific to each derived representation. Therefore, the scope of this architecture is limited by what can be expressed in UML and how that information is utilised to generate formal statements. But from our experience it is sufficient to cover all the needs of establishing semantic interoperability standards. Relations between the artefacts are depicted in the figure above. The conceptual model is the source from which a) the data shapes, b) the formal ontology and c) the data specification document can be generated. Each artefact in the figure is qualified with two terms, the representation standard and the most characteristic feature. The conceptual model is expressed in UML language and shall be conformant with the conventions provided in this style guide and the interpretation rules [CMC-R2]. The formal ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language and shall be lightweight as indicated in this convention [SC-R2]. The data shape is expressed in SHACL language and is characterised by the appropriate level of permissiveness [DSC-R2]. The documentation is represented in HTML format and the wording used shall be as precise as possible to capture the meaning accurately and clearly express the intention of the authors. Although not shown in this diagram, the generation of other artefacts is not excluded. For example, more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity) can also be included in the data specification as additional artefacts (see note on [SC-R2]). The figure above depicts that it is also possible to derive from the conceptual model additional artefacts, such as the XSD or JSON schemas and JSON-LD context definitions. These, however, are not addressed in this style guide. One condition the conceptual model shall satisfy is that it shall comply with a set of pre-established conventions (general conventions and UML conventions) and have a fixed interpretation [CMC-R2]. The guidelines in this document enable and constrain the transformation process, making it precise enough to implement a toolchain that automatically performs conformance checking and necessary transformation operations. How this is done, however, is beyond the scope of this document, and the reader may refer to SEMIC toolchain [semic] or other similar implementations such as model2owl [model2owl] or OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain] projects. For any given data specification, various concerns shall be addressed separately, each in a dedicated artefact type. Therefore, the CVs or APs shall be published as a set of artefacts, each addressing a specific concern. The union of these artefacts forms the intended semantic data specification [What is a semantic data specification?]. The table below summarises which artefacts shall be published for each type of data specification addressed in the SEMIC context. Conceptual model (UML) Ontology (OWL 2) Data shape (SHACL) Specification document (HTML) Model diagram (PNG) Core Vocabulary Mandatory Mandatory Optional (shall be permissive) Mandatory Optional (recommended) Application Profile Mandatory Optional (shall be an extension) Mandatory Mandatory Optional (recommended) The semantic data specifications, both CVs and APs, are conceived as a union of specification artefacts, each addressing a different aspect/concern: conceptual model expressed in UML formal ontology expressed in OWL 2 data shapes expressed in SHACL data specification document realised in HTML conceptual model diagrams expressed in any image format (PNG, for example) In the SEMIC context two types of data specifications are of main concern (a) Core Vocabularies designed with broad interoperability goals and (b) Application Profiles designed with application oriented interoperability goals. In this document, we will refer to these data specification types to provide guideline refinements depicting variations based on the data specification type. The primary concern and the intention in each of them differ as follows: Core Vocabularies aim at establishing the shared vocabulary as a lightweight ontology essentially, and optionally some data shapes if necessary [Core Vocabulary]. Application Profiles aim at setting carefully designed data shapes on reused concepts from one or several existent ontologies and, optionally, a minimal ontology with specialised vocabulary [Application Profile]. The secondary concerns are present and common in both data specification types and are, in fact, instrumental to consistent production, maintenance and publication: Editing of the conceptual model Production of data specification document The data specification’s artefacts are not independent but tightly interrelated and transformed from one form into another one. It is difficult to draw a clear line between semantic and technical interoperability artefacts and concerns. This section aims at providing some guidelines and hints on how to distinguish between the two (but no guidelines on technical artefacts are considered as this is out of scope of this work). The best way to look at them is in terms of concerns addressed within each layer, which resembles a lot the discussion on distinguishing \"Conceptual Data Models\", \"Logical Data Models\" and \"Physical Data Models\" in ANSI [ansi] from 1975. EIF [eif] defines the technical interoperability as covering the applications and infrastructures linking systems and services. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to: interface specifications, interconnection services, data integration services, data presentation and exchange, secure communication protocols, access boundaries, information boundaries, etc. The technical layer deals with how to represent, how to transmit data, how the data/entities are bundled when served by a service (i.e. API design or transmission, with impact on performance, usability, and interface), what are the access rights, how is the security ensured, access and storage performance, interfacing with the service, usability, etc. EIF defines the semantic interoperability as ensuring that precise (format and) meaning of exchanged data and information is understood throughout exchanges between parties: \"what is sent is what is understood\". It covers two aspects: semantic and syntactic. The semantic aspect refers to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them. The syntactic aspect refers to describing the exact format of the information to be exchanged in terms of grammar and format. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to developing vocabularies and define data meaning in exchanges. This layer is agnostic to access right, security, transmission protocol, physical representation, how it is presented to the user, etc. In the SEMIC context, Semantic Web and Linked Data technology standards are chosen by default. This means that the syntactic aspect is covered by the RDF specifications [rdf], whereas the semantic aspect is addressed within the Core Vocabulary and Application Profile, expressed in OWL 2 [owl2] and SHACL [shacl] languages. Connecting the semantic layer and the technical layers may not always be straightforward. Three types of technical artefacts are of a particular importance, which rely on three different technologies: XML and XSD, JSON and JSON schema, and relational databases. We briefly comment on each below. RDF. In case the system is gnostic of Semantic Web technologies, if the implementation uses RDF natively, then the technical layer is (near) isomorphic to the semantic specification. There is a perfect alignment. JSON. When system implementation is based on JSON representations, a mapping shall be provided to establish semantics-syntax alignment. Luckily, how such an alignment is done is already specified in the JSON-LD standard specification [json-ld]. It contains a canonical mapping algorithm. The syntaxt semantic binding is provided by the so-called context definitions. As a consequence, if the JSON structure is ought to be aligned with the semantic specification, it imposes a strong constraint on how it shall be organised, otherwise the mapping is not possible. So, an advantage of JSON-LD is that the semantics gets coupled nicely with the syntax, and it is in the reach of the developer. XML. When the system implementation is based on XML representation, then the interplay between syntax and semantics is more problematic, as there is NO canonical way os linking the two. The only transformation we have is the XSLT [xslt] but no mapping language exists like in the case of JSON-LD. Hence, if one provides a mapping to an XSD schema, then one must also provide the XSLT specification that interprets that mapping. Furthermore, when we want to establish an alignment between syntax and semantics there is no constraint on the structure (like in the case of JSON). It is only good practices and alternative technologies, such as RML, that we can rely on in this case. [rml]. RDB. If the implementation is based on relational databases, the story is similar to the XML. There is no organic way of mapping syntax and semantics. The mapping is at the level of the database schema, and there is no canonical way of doing this. So, just like in the case of XML we rely on good practices and alternative technologies to encode an interpretation, such as D2RML [d2rm] and RML [rml]. Ideally, syntax-binding artefacts that show how to map from a semantic data specification into technical layer artefacts is also provided as part of the specification. Showing how to interface with the semantic layer is especially important when Application Profiles (and Implementation Model specifications) are developed and published.","title":"Architectural clarifications","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"arhitectural-clarifications","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/arhitectural-clarifications.html","titles":[{"text":"Consumer context","hash":"_consumer_context","id":1},{"text":"Editorial context","hash":"_editorial_context","id":2},{"text":"Separation of concerns and transformation","hash":"sec:separation-of-concerns-and-transformation","id":3},{"text":"Separation of concerns in SEMIC","hash":"sec:separation-of-concerns-in-SEMIC","id":4},{"text":"Editorial synchronisation problem","hash":"_editorial_synchronisation_problem","id":5},{"text":"Transformation of the conceptual model","hash":"sec:transformation","id":6},{"text":"Data specification and artefact types","hash":"sec:data-specification-and-artefact-types","id":7},{"text":"Artefact types","hash":"sec:artefact-types","id":8},{"text":"Data specification types","hash":"sec:data-specification-types","id":9},{"text":"Technical artefacts and concerns","hash":"sec:technical-concerns-and-artefacts","id":10}]},"63":{"id":63,"text":"In the Semantic Web literature, the term \"reuse\" appears very often, encouraging the adoption of data specifications in new data specifications rather than redefining the same/similar concepts once again. The term \"reuse\" is usually considered in a broad sense, and what it means in terms of specific implementations is often left underspecified. In this section, we aim to address this gap and provide a detailed account of what \"reuse\" means in the SEMIC context. Specification reuse is the act of sourcing an established specification into a new one (referred to as the \"current\" or \"own\" specification). Technically, reuse may mean either or both of the following: Importing (using owl:imports) the contents of another ontology or data shape specification into a current one; OR relying on URI dereferencing to get the formal definition of the ontology (this, however, does not work for the data shapes) In the SEMIC context, for the purpose of interoperability, we need to carefully constrain the meaning of the term \"reuse\" with a fine-grained description on a construct-by-construct basis, and this is the aim of the remainder of this section. The following subsections offer a systematic description of six cases of reuse based on what is reused: (a) a class or (b) a property, and types of frequently encountered variations: (i) as-is, (ii) with terminological adaptations, and (iii) with semantic adaptations. In each case, we describe as appropriate the implications on the following aspects: How to denote it: (a) as-is or (b) as a specialisation Label Definition Impact of adding new properties (for classes only) Impact of reusing original properties (for classes only) Impact on domain and range (for properties only) Other constraints and additional information This scenario applies when the original class is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed New properties on the class In data shapes (SHACL), the class can be used for in domain/range property constraints. In UML, properties are depicted as new connections (object properties) that are incoming and outgoing to the class or as new attributes (data properties) that appear in the class. This works because OWL 2 semantics treats properties as first-class citizens (along with classes, datatypes and individuals). So even if the UML class diagram may visualise new properties on the class, they shall be read as constructs defined separately from one another, just as the OWL 2 specification defines it [owl2]. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Also, make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification In OWL 2 & SHACL, when reusing a class as-is from an established ontology hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class are considered adopted (even if some may be irrelevant). It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In UML, all properties marked as mandatory in the original data specification are considered relevant and shall be depicted. Optional properties may be depicted only if relevant in the new context. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for reuse. This scenario applies when the original class is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-class that captures the adaptations is recommended as the safe option. Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics must stay the same. Differentiation through using preferred and alternative labels is a strong recommendation and should be implemented as described below. In UML, - the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) - the (original) URI of the reused class shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) - the original label of the reused concept shall be preserved (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, - the original label is adopted as is (e.g. either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) - the new label is added as an alternative label (e.g. skos:altLabel) In the documentation, - the new label displayed as the main label (in titles and any other fronting) - the original label (to be visibly mentioned) Definition NO change allowed Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g. skos:scopeNote). New properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Original properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Example For example, the wording of FOAF definitions can benefit from light adaptations and adjustments, yet the meaning is not changing. Hence, in Core Person Vocabulary, the definitions are slightly adjusted. Such adaptations might be made when the original label or definition does not follow the guidelines laid out in this document. For example, the one on circular definitions [GC-R5]. This scenario applies when the original class is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Must reuse as a specialisation. Must create a subclass that captures the adaptations and indicate reuse by the subclass relationship. If the reused class is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused class Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the reused class New properties on the class Add new properties as necessary on the new (owned) sub-class. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification When reusing a class as-is from a data specification, hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class should be adopted. In UML, include all properties and constraints in the UML diagram if marked as mandatory in the original. For the sake of brevity, optional properties and constraints can be omitted. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for the purpose of reuse. If a reused original property must be made more specific or nuanced, then it is a good idea to create a sub-property of the already existing one. See property reuse recommendations below. Example For example, in the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary, the reused class org:Organisation is specialised as cv:PublicOrganisation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed Domain and range If the reused property * does not define a domain and range (in the original ontology) AND * its definition does NOT mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape) then it can be attached in UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) to any class either as a) a relation (pointing to another class) or b) as an attribute with a specific datatype. If the reused property * defines a domain and range (in the original ontology) OR * its definition DOES mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape), then it must be reflected in the UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) accordingly, i.e. it can be applied only on specified classes. When UML is transformed into other representations, it is not recommended to represent the domain/range definitions in the lightweight ontology (OWL 2). Still, it may be reflected in data shape definitions (SHACL) as constraints. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocs, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but better reflect them as constraints in SHACL, where necessary (i.e. optional properties can stay free of domain/range specification) [CS-R2]. Note: in the case of narrow reuse intention, as for the application profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range constraints in the data shape definitions (using SHACL) even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information When reusing a property as-is from a data specification, then all constraints associated with the property should be adopted. It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In no way should the UML contain conflicting constraints compared to the original data specification. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-property that captures the adaptations is recommended as a safe option, however. If the reused property, is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model, and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics MUST stay the same. We strongly recommend differentiating between preferred labels and alternative labels and should be implemented as described below. In UML, * the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) * URI of the reused property shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) * the original label of the reused concept shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, * original label (as is, either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) * new label (as an alternative label, skos:altLabel) In the documentation, * original label (to be visibly mentioned) * new label (in titles and any other fronting) Definition Changes are NOT allowed. Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g., skos:scopeNote ). Domain and range Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Other constraints and additional information Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Example For example, in DCAT-AP the reused property adms:status is relabeled from \"status\" to \"change type\" for Catalogue Record class. Note that the diagram does not reflect this, but it is reflected in the associated documentation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Must create a sub-property that captures the adaptations. In UML, a connector is created denoting a new property, which specialises another connector denoting the original property. Additionally, notes or hyperlinks shall be provided to the original source. Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused property Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the one of the reused property Domain and range If the reused super property does NOT define domain/range, then it is possible to add domain/range specifications to the sub-property, but only if justified and absolutely necessarily. In UML, feel free to attach it anywhere needed. If the reused super property DOES define a domain/range, DO not override them, i.e. do not specify a new domain/range that leads to logical inconsistencies. Specifically, if you do that, then make sure that the new Domain is a subclass of the Original Domain. If the property is used across multiple classes multiple domain/range specifications can be deemed appropriate. This shall be handled with care. Multiple domain/range definitions in OWL 2 mean intersection (i.e. joined by logical AND) and not the union (i.e. joined by logical OR), as most use cases may require. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocabularies, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but optionally reflect them as permissive constraints in SHACL. In case of narrow reuse intention, as for the Application Profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range specifications in the data shape definitions even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information Feel free to provide any additional information that is deemed necessary. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. Example For example, in the DCAT-AP the reused property dct:hasPart is specialised as dcat:dataset. Note that the subproperty relation between the two is not depicted in the diagram, but is stated in the data shape specification.","title":"Clarifications on \"reuse\"","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"clarification-on-reuse","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/clarification-on-reuse.html","titles":[{"text":"What is the reuse of an (ontology or data shape) specification?","hash":"sec:what-is-the-reuse-of-a-specification","id":1},{"text":"Reuse of a class as-is","hash":"sec:reuse-of-a-class-as-is","id":2},{"text":"Reuse of a class with terminological adaptations","hash":"sec:reuse-of-a-class-with-terminological-adaptations","id":3},{"text":"Reuse of a class with semantic adaptations","hash":"sec:reuse-of-a-class-with-semantic-adaptations","id":4},{"text":"Reuse of a property as-is","hash":"sec:reuse-of-a-property-as-is","id":5},{"text":"Reuse of a property with terminological adaptations","hash":"sec:reuse-of-a-property-with-terminological-adaptations","id":6},{"text":"Reuse of a property with semantic adaptations","hash":"sec:reuse-of-a-property-with-semantic-adaptations","id":7}]},"64":{"id":64,"text":"Title: Conceptual model as single source of truth Identifier CMC-R1 Statement The UML conceptual model should be used as single source of truth. Description By applying this principle, we can achieve consistency among all derived artefacts. This implies: Standard representation of the UML, such as XMI Existence of a well-defined set of rules and conventions to transform UML model into other artefacts, which can be executed, as much as possible automatically, by a dedicated software tool or toolchain [CMC-R2] It is recommended that recent versions of the UML (v2.5+) and XMI (v2.5+) specifications are used [epo-cmc, sec 4.1]. Title: Fixed UML interpretation Identifier CMC-R2 Statement: The UML conceptual model must have a fixed interpretation. Description: Using UML as a graphical language to encode a data specification according to the reuse guidelines requires defining a set of pre-established conventions on the UML notation to reach a fixed interpretation. The interpretation of UML as a logical structure, including OWL 2, was and still is an active research topic. But even the OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel [omg-onto] does not address the notion of reuse. The goal of using UML is to provide for the SEMIC semantic data specifications a standard graphical notation, which many are familiar with. Therefore, the graphical notation should facilitate the understanding of the data specification. The UML notation should match the semantics that are to be expressed in the data specification (the ontology, data shapes and human-readable documentation). The UML is the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. Using the conventions and associated interpretation expressed in this rule, other artefacts are derived from the UML. The benefit of defining such a precise set of mapping rules is that it allows for: Implementing tools to transform UML into derivative artefacts, thus enabling UML as the single source of truth. Implementing tools for formal checking against the established conventions (interpretation), thus enforcing correctness, conformance and consistency. These rules will increase the coherency of the UML diagrams across projects and organisations. Within SEMIC, the interpretation is implemented by the SEMIC toolchain [semic]. The table below provides recommended interpretations of UML elements in OWL 2 and SHACL. These interpretations can be considered high-level mapping rules implementable into transformation tools that generate OWL 2 ontology and, respectively, SHACL constraints from the UML conceptual model.

Examples: The UML interpretation applied by the SEMIC toolchain is described in [semic-toolchain]. To assist the editor while data modelling to choose the best representation, a test suite is available covering all modelling patterns. The SEMIC toolchain shares the same interpretation as the OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain]. In the context of eProcurement ontology, a toolchain has been developed to transform and validate UML models. Such tools are based on two documents: UML convention specifications [epo-cmc] and UML transformation specifications [epo-cm2owl]. Title: Element names and URIs Identifier CMC-R3 Statement: All UML Element names should be fit for URI generation with clear namespace organisation. Description: This convention aims at ensuring that URIs can be generated from UML Element names and shall be treated as an extension to the terminology style conventions [GC-R4]. The Element names are intended as human-readable denominations (called labels) and as machine-readable denominations (called identifiers). This means that the Element names serve as the primary source for generating URIs [puri-bp] to ensure unambiguous machine-readable reference to a formal construct. serve as the primary source for generating labels to ensure human readers' comprehension follow an organisation of namespaces Thus, in the UML model, the Element names must conform to RDF [rdf] and XML [xml] format specifications. Both languages effectively require that terms begin with an upper or lower case letter from the ASCII character set or an underscore (_). This tight restriction means that, for example, terms may not begin with a number, hyphen or accented character [cv-meth]. Although underscores are permitted, they are discouraged as they may be, in some cases, misread as spaces. A formal definition of these restrictions is given in the XML specification document [xml]. Note that, when the UML Element name cannot be used to effectively denominate and identify the concept then, UML Element Tags may be used to express explicitly URIs, labels, notes and other types of annotations [CMC-R6]. Internationalisation, if required, should be provided through the use of the UML Element Tags to specify labels that will be used for generation of specification documents in languages other than English. Country specific data specifications, which are meant to be used primarily at a national level, might decide to relax on this convention and permit the use of Unicode characters in the Element names, which will result in the generations of IRIs, instead of URIs [iri]. However, this is unnecessary, and strongly discouraged, in the SEMIC context. Following this convention is also important in the context of generation of persistent URIs [PC-R2] according to the principles laid out in [10rules-puri]. Examples: The class Address in Core Location has several properties. All the properties have a displayed name (e.g. \"addressArea\") with the UML class diagram and associated UML Tags, such as a label for the HTML specification (\"address area\"), definition, usage note and the related URI. Title: Case sensitivity and charset Identifier CMC-R4 Statement: All UML Element names are case-sensitive and shall follow the CamelCase convention. Description: The names begin with an upper or lower case letter (A–Z, a–z) for all terms in the model. Digits (0–9) are allowed in the subsequent character positions. [epo-cmc, sec 4.2] Moreover, we can significantly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent capitalisation for concept names; therefore, UML Element names shall be CamelCased [epo-cmc, sec 3.2], [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.20]. The names of UML Classes shall start with an upper-case letter, UML Attributes shall start with a lower-case letter, UML Connectors (including Target Roles and Source Roles) shall start with a lower-case letter. The names of UML Enumerations, Packages and Datatypes may start with a lower-case or upper-case letter. Examples: In the image below, there are two classes from Core Location with the related properties and a relation between them. The name of the classes are in UpperCamelCase, the name of the properties are in lowerCamelCase and the relation (adminUnit) is in lowerCamelCase. Title: Namespaces and prefixes in element names Identifier CMC-R5 Statement: Element names shall be organised by namespaces. Namespaces may be indicated through prefixes delimited by colon (:) character, forming qualified names. Description: To enable the reuse of names defined in other models, and the reuse of unique references for names that support easy identification, namespace management must be considered. We adopt the XML and RDF approach to defining and managing namespaces [xml-ns]. A namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organise objects of various kinds so that these objects may be referred to by name and uniquely identifiable [urn]. A qualified name denotes the URI, which is composed of concatenating the expanded prefix with the local segment [turtle]. A qualified name is a name subject to namespace interpretation [xml-ns]. Syntactically, they are either prefixed names or un-prefixed names. A binding declaration shall be maintained, which binds prefixes to namespace URIs and a default namespace applicable to un-prefixed Element names. As the Element name is the primary source for deriving URIs, a base URI and a local segment are necessary. The Element name prefix, before the colon, plays the role of namespace name indicating which base URI shall be used, while the Element name, after the colon, is the local segment. See [xml-ns] for more info. In case the editor decides to omit to specify a prefix in the Element name when a URI generation logic is devised, an implicit prefix can be assumed by default. The qualified names may be structured as follows: prefix:localSegment :localSegment localSegment Note: The prefixes and namespaces shall be well-defined, maintained, and published as part of the data specification. Examples: When dcat a namespace name is declared as bound to base URI http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#, then dcat:Catalog is the qualified name from which the http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Catalog URI is interpreted. When cv (short for Core Vocabularies) namespace name is declared bound to base URI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/, then cv:adminUnit is the qualified name from which the http://data.europa.eu/m8g/adminUnit URI is generated. Title: Rich annotations through tags Identifier CMC-R6 Statement: UML Tags can be conveniently used for annotating the Elements. Description: UML Element tags are key-value pairs that are associated with a UML Element (class, attribute, connector, etc.). The tags can be used as an extension mechanism to the UML language. They can be used to provide information that is not expressible anywhere else on a UML Element. For example, in this style guide, we recommend that the UML Element name shall be used to derive both the concept URI and the concept preferred label. However, if the model editor chooses to use the UML Element name for deriving the concept label alone, then the URI needs to be specified elsewhere. This is one example of how the UML tags can be used: simply specify a new tag, \"uri\", and provide the concept URI as a value (see figure below). Another example where tags came in handy is the provisioning of notes of various types. According to the UML standard, UML Elements have only one general description. We recommend using this description solely for definitions. Yet the scope notes, examples, alternative labels, and any other annotations can be provisioned through the UML tagging mechanism (see figure below). Examples: Title: Explicit depiction of external dependencies Identifier CMC-R7 Statement: The UML diagrams should depict how the developed model relates to external (reused) models. Description: UML does not support an import mechanism comparable to the one specified in OWL 2. Yet, the reuse of models is a highly encouraged practice. To accommodate such practice, the reused Elements shall be created as in the original model and depicted in diagrams. The external Elements shall be clearly marked. The easiest way to do so is by providing a namespace prefix. The original meaning shall be preserved without changes to the labels, concept definitions or URIs. Reused classes shall be depicted in the UML diagrams. Reused properties shall be depicted in diagrams as connectors and attributes. It is not necessary to depict unused classes or properties [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.7]. Examples: In the example below, a Core Vocabulary Person includes concepts from another vocabulary (FOAF); thus the two classes Person and Agent have the \"foaf\" namespace prefix specified in front. Please note that this is an example of reuse with semantic adaptation. In CPV the Person is more restricted than that in FOAF. The foaf:Person class represents people. Something is a foaf:Person if it is a person, and it does not matter whether they are alive, dead, real or imaginary. The foaf:Person class is a subclass of the foaf:Agent class, since all people are considered 'agents' in FOAF. In contrast to that, cpv:Person is defined differently: A individual human being who may be dead or alive, but not imaginary. Hence, the subclass relation. Title: Class inheritance Identifier CMC-R8 Statement: Ensure that the attributes and associations of a superclass apply to all its subclasses. Description: This is a general modelling principle that should be respected, yet when it comes to reusing, such a requirement is often overlooked. This means that the model editor shall carefully analyse the reused model as a whole and how it is integrated with their own model. Examples: In Core Business Vocabulary, the class LegalEntity is a subclass of org:FormalOrganization from the Organization Ontology (which is a subclass of org:Organization, which is a subclass of foaf:Agent), and different properties/relations have been inherited such as hasSubOrganization, hasMember, name, type. See more [oslo-rules sec 3.2.3] Title: Abstract classes Identifier CMC-R9 Statement: Classes that are not intended to be instantiated directly can be marked as abstract. Description: When a (super-)class is created for capturing a level of abstraction in the domain knowledge, it may not always be suitable for instantiation. Editors may choose to mark such classes as abstract and to indicate that their subclasses shall be used in practice. In UML, this can be done via > stereotype [see CMC-R17: Using stereotypes]. Doing so has no impact on the OWL 2 [owl2] representation of the model (as this cannot be expressed in OWL). However, depending on the toolchain implementation, SHACL data shapes [shacl] can be generated to express that no instances of this class shall not occur in the data. See [oslo-rules sec 3.2.6, epo-cmc, sec 4.4] Examples: Both OSLO [oslo-toolchain] and ePO [epo] toolchains support such stereotypes. Title: Attribute definition and usage Identifier CMC-R10 Statement: UML Attributes shall be used to define properties taking simple datatype values. An attribute declaration should specify its datatype and multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: We recommend atomic types are used as attribute types and avoid using another class as the attribute type. Instead, those should be expressed as relationships (represented by Association connectors) between the two classes [CMC-R12]. The reason for this is to keep a clear separation between (a) properties that take a literal value (governed by a datatype, and conceptually corresponding to owl:DatatypeProperty) and (b) properties that take a reference value (governed by a class, corresponding to owl:ObjectProperty). Doing so has two advantages: (a) it confers homogeneity to the model, which enhances readability and decreases ambiguity; (b) the toolchain implementation is easier as there is a clear treatment and interpretation. literal properties (expressed as attributes datatypes) and relations between two classes (expressed as association connectors). The advantage of In case of primitive datatypes, high preference shall be given to using OWL 2 compliant XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf] standard datatypes. For more detailed recommendations on the use of primitive datatypes see convention [CMC-R18]. Properties whose values come from a controlled vocabulary or authority table constitute a special case, because two modelling practices are recognised here: (a) as attributes with type \"Code\", and (b) as dependency relations pointing to a UML Enumeration named after the controlled list. In the first case, the attribute type \"Code\" shall be mapped to the skos:Concept class. The advantage of this approach is the compactness of the diagrams, as fewer boxes appear in them. The disadvantage is the omission to specify precisely, which list the property values are restricted to. Arguably, the controlled list can be provided via the additional UML Tags [CMC-R6], but that value will not be visible in the diagrams. In the second case, the property is modelled not as an attribute but by using a UML Dependency connector between the UML Class, and the UML Enumeration representing the controlled list, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It denotes that the OWL 2 class has an owl:ObjectProperty whose range is of type skos:Concept and is limited to values of the specified controlled vocabulary. The connector must have a \"Source→Target\" direction. No other directions are acceptable, and a valid target role name and multiplicity shall be provided [CMC-R14]. Finally, we emphasise that UML Connectors are reserved for the object properties only. Hence, none shall be established between a UML Class element and a UML Datatype element. Examples: Here we provide an example for the two approaches of specifying attribute datatypes described above. In the CCCEV specification, the class attributes of the Requirement and Evidence classes use loose UML and other datatypes: String, Literal, and Code. No precise definition of what they mean is provided. The attributes are left underspecified, and with generic datatypes: the description attribute is a generic String, while the type and confidentialityLevelType attributes are specified as Code (without explicitly indicating what this datatype means). It is also not clear what would be the difference between Literal and String, although one might gain an intuition from the attribute names. The same classes are reused in the ePO ontology, where the cccev:Requirement and cccev:Evidence class attributes explicitly specify standard datatypes and cardinalities. Additionally, the cccev:confidentialityLevelType attribute, and also the cccev:type attribute, although not depicted in the screenshot, indicated in the original specification, were converted to dependency connectors, because they are not using an atomic datatype, but rather a controlled list of skos:Concept(s) coming from controlled vocabularies, such as at-voc:confidentiality-level. Title: Multiplicity of attributes and connectors Identifier CMC-R11 Statement: The multiplicity of connectors and class attributes should be specified, indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. The cardinality shall be as permissive as possible in Core Vocabularies and as restrictive as necessary in Application Profiles. Description: If the UML model is developed to represent a Core Vocabulary, then the property cardinality (both UML Attributes and UML Association) shall be as permissive as possible, for example, [0..*], meaning any occurrence is allowed. If a structural feature (attribute or association) is irrelevant for the domain or the applications, instead of setting a lower limit of multiplicity to 0, simply remove it from the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. However, in the UML models representing Application Profiles, special attention shall be given to the multiplicity, reducing variation in the instance data to a minimum. And if a property (attribute or connector) is mandatory in the data, then its minimum cardinality shall be set to 1, for example [1..*] [epo-cmc, sec 4.5]. A good practice is to always indicate cardinality. It may be left unspecified, but this is not recommended. When in doubt, it is recommended to fall back on the implicit assumption of [0..*]. Not to be confused with the default cardinality assumed in tools. For example, Enterprise Architect by default assumes [1..1] cardinality for attributes and omits to display it; and a similar default assumption exists in XML/XSD. Notation for multiple cardinality can be either with * or n. In principle using either notation is fine, however, it is recommended to use only one of those notations within a given data specification consistently, if possible, to enhance readability. It is worth highlighting this, as some UML tools, by default, might use a different notation for multiple cardinality depending on whether it is specifying the cardinality of attributes vs. that of connectors. The UML processing tools should be implemented so as to handle either of those notations, as their meaning is identical. Unless, well explained, no rigid constraints shall be imposed on attributes and associations. In other words, if specified, the cardinality shall be the most permissive, where possible [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Limit the constraints to business rules, do not add technical constraints to the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.16]. If an attribute or an association from a reused vocabulary is irrelevant, do not set the lower limit of multiplicity to 0, but simply omit it in the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Examples: All Core Vocabularies have set a permissive cardinality [0..*], for example, all the properties of Public Organisation, shown with ligh orange background, have multiplicity [0..*], while the same Public Organisation reused in CPSV-AP, shown in blue, has mandatory properties: Title: Connector definition and usage Identifier CMC-R12 Statement: UML Connectors shall be used to define relations and properties taking non-atomic type values. A connector declaration should specify multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: UML Connectors shall be used to denote object properties (see OWL 2 semantics, [owl2]). First, we explain how the connectors ought to be used, i.e., where to specify the relationship names and multiplicity. Then we explain the optional usage of the dependency connector type. On connector names, a generic UML connector may have a name applied to it, and it may have source/target roles specified in addition. This provides flexibility to how the domain knowledge may be expressed in UML; however, this freedom increases the level of ambiguity as well. Therefore, we foresee two distinct ways to express properties: using the connector (generic) name or using the connector source/target ends. We strongly recommend using the source/target role name to indicate the relation name and leave empty the (generic) element name. So, if a target role is specified, then no connector name can be specified. Optionally a source role may be provided to indicate the inverse relation. In this case, the relation direction must be changed from \"Source → Target\" to \"Bidirectional\". Or conversely, if the connector direction is \"Bidirectional\", then source and target roles must be provided. No other directions are permitted. It is recommended that each association has a definition. The definition is then used for each role as they represent the same meaning manifested in the inverse direction. Alternatively, definitions can be specified along the target and source roles. UML defines multiple types of connectors. We recommend relying mainly on the UML Association connector type. Optionally a UML Dependency Connector type may be used if the meaning and usage conditions are well-defined. The UML Association connectors represent relations between a source and a target classes. The association connector cannot be used between other kinds of UML Elements. The UML Dependency connector may be used between a UML Class and UML Enumeration boxes, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It indicates the class has an owl:ObjectProperty, whose range is a controlled vocabulary [CMC-R14]. The connector must have the direction \"Source → Target\". No other directions are acceptable. The UML Generalization connector signifies a class-subClass relation and is transformed into rdfs:subClassOf relation standing between a source and target classes. The connector must have no name or source/target roles specified in the UML model. If a model class should inherit a class from an external model, then proxies must be created for those classes [GC-R1, Reuse of a class with semantic adaptation]. For example, if Person specialises a foaf:Agent. Title: All elements are \"public\" Identifier CMC-R13 Statement: The visibility of all UML Elements should be \"public\". Description: For semantic data specifications, accessibility to the information is not a concern. The sole concern is to specify the semantics of the information as precisely as possible. Therefore, the UML access or privacy annotations shall not be interpreted, and the \"+\" symbol shall always be used next to each property. This symbol means \"public\" [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.22]. Examples: The Person class in Core Vocabulary Person only has public properties indicated with a \"+\" symbol next to each property. Title: Controlled lists as Enumerations Identifier CMC-R14 Statement: The controlled lists of values shall be referred to as UML Enumerations and specified whenever possible. Description: References to controlled lists shall be done via UML Enumeration elements. Content and lifecycle management of controlled lists shall be separated from the management of the semantic data specification. Controlled lists play an essential role in establishing interoperability standards. Management and publication of controlled lists are not part of this style guide. The expectation is that the controlled lists are published in accordance with best practices and represented with the SKOS model using persistent identifiers. In such an approach, the controlled list is expressed as a skos:ConceptScheme and the specific values as skos:Concept(s). Also, such controlled lists are often developed, published and maintained independently following their own lifecycle, so that they can be reused in other models. Two use-cases can be identified in practice: (a) when the code list is known and is explicitly referred to as the range of a property, and (b) when a property is modelled but no code list reference is provided as its range. When the authors of a conceptual model intend to omit which controlled list shall be used, then a class attribute with the range skos:Concept (in some cases Code is preferred) can be created to indicate that. This approach can be useful in situations when multiple (external) controlled lists can be used interchangeably. For example, the adms:status property of a dcat:CatalogueRecord shall be a skos:Concept, without specifying the controlled list. It is advisable, however, to be specific concerning which controlled list shall be used. In such cases, an Enumeration shall be created representing the controlled list. The Enumeration shall be empty, i.e., not specifying any value, because the values are assumed to be maintained externally and only the reference is necessary. The properties having this controlled list as range shall be depicted as UML connectors (dependencies or associations) between a Class and an Enumeration [CMC-R2]. For example, in ePO, dct:Location can have a country code represented as a dependency relation to at-voc:country (the country authority table published on the EU Vocabularies website). The name of the Enumeration shall be resolved to a URI identical to that of the skos:ConceptScheme. As for the connector type we recommend using a dependency connector (depicted with a dashed line) because the semantic interpretation differs slightly from the association connector (depicted with a continuous line). Namely, the range of the property has to fulfil two constraints: (a) instantiating the skos:Concept class and (b) being skos:inScheme the intended controlled list [epo-arch]. If the controlled list is specific to the model then the author shall define the values of the UML Enumeration inside of it, which are interpreted as concepts belonging to the containing concept scheme [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.17]. Examples: The COFOG controlled list is suggested in Core Public Organisation to describe the purpose of an Organisation (as depicted in the image on top) while in CPSV-AP, the same COFOG list is used to indicate the functions of government which a public service is intended for (as depicted in the image below). While the COFOG controlled list is owned by the UN and maintained by the Publications Office in the form of SKOS concept schemes, it can be reused by the Core Public Organisation and CPSV-AP independently. Title: Partition the model into packages Identifier CMC-R15 Statement: Packages have no semantic value, but shall be used whenever possible to logically organise the model. Description: It is highly recommended to avoid defining any semantic interpretation into UML Packages, as they are best used for organisational purposes, defining logical partitions in the model. Therefore, packages can serve as a method of slicing the conceptual model into subdomains. It is also possible to use packages as namespace indicators. Although it works well for classes, it fails to cover the needs for managing namespaces of connectors and attributes. Moreover, it does not work in cases when an attribute, or a connector is used multiple times in several packages. Hence, namespace management is easier attained by using other methods such as using prefixes in Element names or using Element tags [epo-cmc, sec 4.3]. Examples: In the image below, each class is organised in a package mapped to a namespace. However, for convenience, Core Vocabularies are in multiple packages but mapped to the same namespace. Title: Diagram readability Identifier CMC-R16 Statement: UML class diagrams shall be organised for readability. Description: UML class diagrams are used for depicting the conceptual model. Their primary purpose is to construe the meaning of concepts, relations and their organisation to the human reader. Therefore, the diagrams shall be optimised for readability. We recommend that the diagrams: are well spaced (proper space between lines, boxes and labels) minimise the number of crossing connectors prefer orthogonal to straight connectors align elements horizontally & vertically space elements evenly avoid overlapping labels and depict all labels align labels horizontally and avoid vertical or oblique alignment place subclasses under or to the right of their parent place the part under or to the right of the whole at aggregates or composites . minimise the number of details are short and concise (multiple small(-er) diagrams are preferred to one large diagram) diagram size: prefer multiple themed small(er) diagrams to large and crowded ones diagrams shall not be bigger than one A4 page simplify complex diagrams: by breaking it down into several smaller diagrams by highlighting certain parts of the diagram by hiding attributes, role names, etc. that are not relevant symbol size: symbols should be equal nothing shall draw more attention unless intended elements of equal importance should be equally large inherited attributes of a superclass shall be visible if the superclass is not in the diagram See also [ oslo-rules, semic-sgdraft ] Examples: In the example below, taken from Core Person, the classes are aligned vertically and horizontally, subclasses are placed just below the related parent class, the relations are horizontal, vertical, or orthogonal. Title: Element stereotypes Identifier CMC-R17 Statement: Stereotypes do not have semantic or normative value. They shall be avoided in the conceptual models unless a good motivation, and a strong need is provided. Description: We strongly encourage semantic practitioners to avoid stereotypes of any normative or semantic value. One common usage of stereotypes is to provide deontic indicators. See [GC-7 on Deontic modals] where we explain why their use is discouraged and what can be done instead. There is a practice to mark some classes as \"abstract\" with the intention of preventing those from being instantiated. This is also a technical level constraint and does not belong in the semantic layer. We acknowledge that stereotypes can be useful for editorial and dissemination purposes; to indicate a classification or grouping of a specific sort. Stereotypes can be used to support concerns specific to an implementation of the transformation toolchain. See the examples below. Examples: Stereotypes can be used to indicate what content goes into various output file during the transformation process. Stereotypes can be used to visually group the class attributes. When applied on the relations (UMl connectors) stereotypes have the opposite effect: that of cluttering and decrease the diagram readability. Title: Datatype definition and usage Identifier CMC-R18 Statement: We strongly recommend that only OWL 2 compliant datatypes are used. The creation of custom datatypes shall be avoided. Description: Similar to [epo-cmc, sec 4.7], this convention draws the distinction between primitive (or atomic) types (consisting of single literal value) and composite types (consisting of multiple attributes) (see also [cv-handbook, sec 3.1]). In fact, the composite datatypes must be defined as classes and handled as such. For example, Amount, Identifier, Quantity and Measurement are to be treated as classes, even if conceptually they could be seen as composite datatypes. It is recommended to employ the primitive datatypes that are already defined in XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf], in particular a subset of those that is OWL 2 compliant. This should cover the standard, and most common types. Thus, definitions of custom datatypes shall be avoided unless the model really needs them. Such cases are, however, rare. The reason for avoiding complex datatypes, is that once we start structuring how data shall be organised, besides syntactic definitions, we inevitably embed semantic aspects as well. Doing so, the semantics of the structure is obscured and trapped in a technical interoperability layer. For example, xsd:duration encodes both the amount(s) and unit(s) of time into a regular expression that looks like this P5Y2M10D. The definition of datatypes in the UML model should be also avoided, even in cases where a toolchain performing the transformation of UML can automatically resolve those into their XSD equivalent using a correspondence table, such as the one presented below. Note that from the family of string datatypes we recommend using the following ones (in this order of preference): rdf:PlainLiteral, rdfs:Literal, xsd:string, and rdf:langString. Often enabling multilingual data specification is a necessity. UML XSD Boolean xsd:boolean Float xsd:float Integer xsd:integer Character, String xsd:string / rdf:langString Short xsd:short Long xsd:long Decimal xsd:decimal Date xsd:date DateTime xsd:dateTime xsd:anyURI Code see CMC-R14 We strongly recommended the use of OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF standard datatypes, if possible. They might be useful also for indicating a specific datatype, which is not possible with the UML ones. For example, making a distinction between a general string (xsd:string) and a literal with a language tag (rdf:langString), or XML encoded ones such as rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral. The table above provides a simplified correspondence between UML and XSD datatypes, but for a complete list of available recommended datatypes the standard specifications shall be consulted: RDF working group XSD Datatype maps RDF 1.1 Datatypes section OWL 2 Datatype Maps","title":"Conceptual model conventions (UML)","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"gc-conceptual-model-conventions","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/gc-conceptual-model-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Conceptual model as single source of truth","hash":"sec:cmc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Fixed UML interpretation","hash":"sec:cmc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Element names and URIs","hash":"sec:cmc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Case sensitivity and charset","hash":"sec:cmc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Namespaces and prefixes in element names","hash":"sec:cmc-r5","id":5},{"text":"Rich annotations through tags","hash":"sec:cmc-r6","id":6},{"text":"Explicit depiction of external dependencies","hash":"sec:cmc-r7","id":7},{"text":"Class inheritance","hash":"sec:cmc-r8","id":8},{"text":"Abstract classes","hash":"sec:cmc-r9","id":9},{"text":"Attribute definition and usage","hash":"sec:cmc-r10","id":10},{"text":"Multiplicity of attributes and connectors","hash":"sec:cmc-r11","id":11},{"text":"Connector definition and usage","hash":"sec:cmc-r12","id":12},{"text":"All elements are \"public\"","hash":"sec:cmc-r13","id":13},{"text":"Controlled lists as Enumerations","hash":"sec:cmc-r14","id":14},{"text":"Partition the model into packages","hash":"sec:cmc-r15","id":15},{"text":"Diagram readability","hash":"sec:cmc-r16","id":16},{"text":"Element stereotypes","hash":"sec:cmc-r17","id":17},{"text":"Datatype definition and usage","hash":"sec:cmc-r18","id":18}]},"65":{"id":65,"text":"Title: Data shape language choice Identifier DSC-R1 Statement: The data shapes shall be expressed in SHACL. Description: There are various languages allowing for data shape expression and thus define validation rules for RDF data. Among the executable ones, the most well-known are SHACL [shacl] and ShEx [shex]. We are aware that a strong community of practice exists for ShEx. However, as SHACL is a W3C standard, we strongly recommend using it. Title: Loose versus rigid constraints Identifier DSC-R2 Statement: In a Core Vocabulary, then the data shape constraints shall be as loose as possible, i.e., permissive, while in an Application Profile, the data shape constraints shall be as rigid as necessary, i.e. restrictive. Description: The Core Vocabularies are intended for a broad reuse and are concerned with establishing the concepts. This is addressed by the ontology artefact. Optionally it may be accompanied by a minimal set of data shape constraints expressing general domain limitations. For example, it may be already defined in the Core Vocabulary that a class cannot be instantiated without certain mandatory properties or that a declared property shall be used only with values from a pre-established controlled vocabulary. If a data shape artefact is provided, then any Application Profile reusing the Core Vocabulary shall not only import the ontology, but the data shapes as well. The Application Profiles are usually intended for narrower use cases and mostly are concerned with setting restrictions on the way reused vocabulary ought to be used. It is a good practice to make such restrictions as restrictive as necessary but still provide space for variation as it typically occurs in practice. This is even more important when an Application Profile is conceived as reusable in other Application Profiles. Examples: Consider DCAT-AP, for example. It is an Application Profile on top of the DCAT vocabulary, but other more specific Application Profiles are still created on top of it (e.g., DCAT-AP CH, DCAT-AP DE, DCAT-AP NO, etc.) Title: Open and Closed world assumptions Identifier DSC-R3 Statement: The data instantiating a core model may be fragmented across information systems. For representation purposes, open-world assumptions shall be adopted, and for validation purposes, a closed-world assumption shall be adopted. Description: Operations on the data, such as automated reasoning and validation, are impacted by what is assumed about its completeness. If it is considered complete, then we say that we operate under the closed-world assumption; otherwise, in the cases of continually evolving and distributed data (that is more in line with reality), the data is considered possibly incomplete, and we say that operating is under the open-world assumption. Under the closed-world assumption, it is presumed that a true statement is also known to be true. Therefore, conversely, what is not currently known to be true, is false [reiter81]. The opposite of the closed-world assumption is the open-world assumption stating that lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. The truth value of a statement may be true despite whether or not it is known to be true. This means that when validating, the data must be considered complete to assess whether it fulfils the imposed constraints or recommended shapes. Therefore, everything that is not known to be true must be considered false. This may have an impact, especially for larger vocabularies (such as the eProcurement ontology), on how the data shapes are organised. As data shapes may be used to suggest how the data may be fragmented and how it shall not. Title: Shape definitions Identifier DSC-R4 Statement: Each ontology class shall be mirrored by a sh:NodeShape. The property constraints may be embedded (contextualised) within node shapes or defined as freestanding. Description: When generating SHACL shapes, it is a good practice to create a node shape for each class in the Conceptual Model and, within it, a property shape for each property of that class. If the property shapes are defined within the node shapes (rather than freestanding), then we mirror the structure depicted in the Conceptual Model. Doing so is intuitive for the readers, the resulting constraint definitions are organically integrated, and the maintenance costs are decreased. However, sometimes it may be useful to define the property shapes as freestanding, therefore making them reusable independent of the node shape context. Freestanding property shapes are universal constraints on the property. They apply to all usages, in all possible data exchanges. Therefore, their use should be limited to those cases that support the broadest reuse context, and do not encode a specific application usage context. As such, freestanding property shapes play more a role in the validation of the correct usage of the property in an application context, rather than in the correct data exchange. The above considerations do not exclude that property shapes used within a node shape could be named with a unique URI, through the reuse of which a coherent network of constraints can be facilitated. The shapes shall be created in a separate namespace in order to allow dereferencing to either OWL 2 or SHACL definitions. In some communities, the URIs used in the OWL 2 specifications are reused in SHACL. The class definitions are extended as node shapes. In SHACL semantics, this is interpreted as an equivalent to specifying a sh:targetNode class. This approach allows the use of a single reference in both the ontology and data shape definition yet specifies separate concerns in separate artefacts. The advantage of the approach is increased consistency and readability while maintenance costs decrease. Yet, this approach does not allow for dereferencing separately OWL 2 or SHACL representations. Hence, it is recommended to avoid such practice. Title: Data shape severity Identifier DSC-R5 Statement: It is recommended to use constraint severity for distinguishing critical violations from non-critical recommendation warnings and from nice-to-have information. Description: Data shapes can be assigned a level of severity. The specific values of severity have no impact on the validation but may be used by user interface tools to categorise validation results. The severity levels are: Info - A non-critical constraint violation indicating an informative message. Warning - A non-critical constraint violation indicating a warning. Violation - A constraint violation.","title":"Data shape conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"gc-data-shape-conventions","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/gc-data-shape-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Data shape language choice","hash":"sec:dsc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Loose versus rigid constraints","hash":"sec:dsc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Open and Closed world assumptions","hash":"sec:dsc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Shape definitions","hash":"sec:dsc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Data shape severity","hash":"sec:dsc-r5","id":5}]},"66":{"id":66,"text":"Title: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible Identifier GC-R1 Statement: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible, respecting the original semantics and lexicalisation. Description: Only use constructs with semantics (human and machine-readable) that support the use case or domain. A similar reflex must be considered by reusing properties and classes from other vocabularies. As a general rule, it is safe to reuse annotation properties, as they carry no logical semantics. Conversely, no concepts shall be redefined unless they are significant variations of the existent ones. In order to achieve a common approach to reuse, apply the reuse guidelines as specified above [Clarification on the reuse]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Prefer maintained vocabularies Identifier GC-R2 Statement: Quality of maintenance and governance should be reviewed before reuse. Reuse mostly vocabularies that are well maintained and governed. Description: Some projects are implemented and closed, while some other ones keep being maintained. The maintenance usually aims at (a) fixing errors, (b) making gradual improvements, and (c) supporting users in using the released data specification, to mention the least. Maintenance of the project can also include URI dereferencing and handling open issues in a timely fashion. Some projects may foresee an evolution roadmap, defined in a change and release policy, with a series of evolution stages planned. Title: Concept reference and terms Identifier GC-R3 Statement: Each concept shall be (a) referenceable by a URI, (b) formally defined and (c) described by a precise, unambiguous human-readable label and definition. Description: Terms and concepts are not the same things. A term is a word, compound word, or multi-word expression that, in specific contexts, is given specific meanings – these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well-named (termed) by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. So, we need a precise way to refer to concepts. The mechanism offering such a possibility is using URIs to establish the identity of a concept’s \"meaning\". URIs also enable referencing, an essential feature of meaning exchange (communication). Such a reference allows for establishing a common meaning, not only between humans and machines but also among humans. Finally, the meaning of the term must be clear. Its definition is associated with the term via the URI. To make the term reusable, it should be published as part of a data specification. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Vocabulary terminology style Identifier GC-R4 Statement: The terminology style shall be consistent across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, some variation in terminology style (concept naming conventions) can be noticed across a wide range of semantic data specifications. Whatever the adopted style may be, the author shall consistently apply it to the whole model. These names will be reflected in all artefacts and in the URIs. Next, we provide a set of loose recommendations: British English is the lingua franca in the model. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations in concept names Classes are names with nouns and singular Names are case-sensitive. Relations and Properties use verbs at a present tense Some practices suggest adding the prefix \"has\" for quality attributes like \"weight\", \"height\", etc. or the prefix or \"is\" for boolean indicators, and some other practices recommend avoiding such prefixes as they add no additional information to the name. Most often, the name of the inverse relation should not be a semantically inverted verb, such as in the case of \"buys/sells\" or \"opens/closes\". It should be done by changing the voice from active to passive, e.g. \"plays/playedBy\". Title: Vocabulary definition styling Identifier GC-R5 Statement: The concept definitions shall be elaborated consistently across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, different styles of defining concepts can be noticed across a range of semantic data specifications. The SEMIC Principles for creating good definitions [semic-defs] are a basis for writing definitions. They are based on advice found in the literature and are the following: Be concise but complete, Avoid over-generalisations. Adapt and contextualise the definition to the surrounding/connected concepts. Make sure that every concept that occurs in the model is directly (or indirectly) defined Describe only one term Structure the definition in a standardised way: Use the singular form to phrase the definition [GC-R4] State what the term is, and don’t enumerate what it is NOT (no negative definition) Use only commonly understood abbreviations Use similar terminology for related definitions Don’t use circular definitions, i.e. the term defined should not be part of the definition, Don’t add secondary information such as additional explanation, scoping, examples, etc. these are to be documented in usage notes. Form the definition in one or more sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a period. Do not start a definition with a repetition of the name of the concept. Rich standard encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 are supported in notes and definitions. In the element names, however, we recommend avoiding any character encodings and using plain ASCII [epo-cmc, sec 4.2]. Title: Reuse compliance Identifier GC-R6 Statement: Compliance with a semantic data specification is satisfied by appropriate usage of terms that is in accordance with definitions and constraints. Compliance checking with an application semantic data specification shall be permissive. This means that what is not forbidden is permitted. If the context requires more restrictions,then an application profile needs to be established for a narrow(er) scenario. Technically, we envisage compliance checking limited to correct referencing of the concept URIs and respecting the cardinality constraints and value constraints in the case of properties. This falls within the scope of data shape definitions. Additionally, more specific compliance requirements and constraints can be added as necessary. Compliance checking may involve multiple levels of severity. For example in the SHACL specifications three levels are defined: Violation, Warning, Info. We assume by default the SHACL severity specifications unless other denotations systems are provided (i.e. different labels and delimitation of severity). Also in absense of specifications, any unfulfilled compliance check is considered a Violation. The semantic data specifications may provide such severity levels. How it is realised in the conceptual model is open at the moment. The main place to provide such specifications is the data shape artefact. In the future we can return to this aspect and provide more guidance. Title: Deontic modals Identifier GC-R7 Statement: Indicators of deontic modalities for classes and properties do not have semantic or normative value. Still they may be used as editorial annotations. Deontic modalities indicate levels obligation, permission, necessity and related concepts. As a general recommendation, to use deontic indicators in the semantic data specifications is discouraged. Such indicators could be of editorial or guiding role for the users and adopters of the data specifications. However, it should be noted that they are not considered as part of any compliance validation or semantic interpretation of the data model. In the standardisation community a common practice is to indicate levels of obligation or permission for concepts in a semantic data specification. Obligation indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is required in an instantiation; while, Permission indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is allowed or forbidden in an instantiation. The common deontic indicator values are: mandatory signifying that a statement using a class or property is required, recommended signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional but recommended, optional signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional, forbidden signifying that a statement using a class or property is not permitted. Still, there are ways to achieve the same effect as the these indicators through other means. For properties, the main instrument is employment of cardinality constraints (per property per class). To make a property mandatory set the minimum cardinality to one or more [1..*], otherwise relax the minimum cardinality constraint to keep the property optional [0..*]. For classes, it is possible to mark a class as abstract, which means that it cannot be directly instantiated, therefore achieving the effect of forbidden. However, deontic indicators shall be avoided for classes because a class may be mandatory and optional in different instantiation or exchange scenarios within the same application profile. For example consider the DCAT-AP and two mandatory classes: dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset. When metadata of a catalogue (and its records) is exchanged, then both classes dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset must be instantiated; however when a single dataset metadata is being exchange then only dcat:Dataset instance shall be provided. Moreover, in the second scenario, providing an instance of dcat:Catalog will be counterproductive and possible leading to errors. Descriptions of what classes can or shall be bundled together when participating in information exchange belong in \"data exchange contracts\", \"API endpoint scheme definitions\" or the likes of these. Such specifications belong in the Technical Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif], and are (currently) out of scope of this style guide, which aims primarily at addressing the semantic interoperability. If semantic engineers prefer or are compelled to employ deontic indicators, then deontic indicators must be precisely defined and those definitions must be published. No reliance on common sense understanding shall be assumed as the meaning of such deontic indicators may (and certainly) differ not only among readers of data specifications but also in different data specifications.","title":"General conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"gc-general-conventions","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/gc-general-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Reuse existing concepts as much as possible","hash":"sec:gc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Prefer maintained vocabularies","hash":"sec:gc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Concept reference and terms","hash":"sec:gc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Vocabulary terminology style","hash":"sec:gc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Vocabulary definition styling","hash":"sec:gc-r5","id":5},{"text":"Reuse compliance","hash":"sec:gc-r6","id":6},{"text":"Deontic modals","hash":"sec:gc-r7","id":7}]},"67":{"id":67,"text":"Title: Follow a methodology Identifier MC-R1 Statement: It is strongly recommended that a clear, explicit methodology is adopted for the content development and lifecycle management of a semantic data specification. Conversely, no data specification shall be developed and managed without following a clear methodology. Description: A methodology is a set of methods, processes, and practices that are repeatedly carried out to deliver projects (TOGAF [togaf]). It helps by using a clear set of processes for managing projects that everyone in the organisation understands, reducing risks, and improving the chances of success. A good methodology that fits the context and environment of an organisation can provide clear guidance on what, who, when, and how a project should be done. It also provides a clear path and a systematic strategy to solve the in-field problems. We do not outline a concrete methodology here but merely point to the benefits of adopting and using one. In the SEMIC context, conceptual model development will benefit greatly from embracing some or a combination of techniques and frameworks in data modelling (e.g. Bottom-Up, Top-Down, Case-Based, Entity-Relationship, Object-Oriented, Star/Snowflake Schema data modelling techniques, etc.), ontology engineering methodologies (e.g. Methontology [fernandez-lopez97], DOGMA [jarrar08], OntoClean [guarino04], TOVE [fox92], DILIGENT [pinto04], NeOn [neon], etc. [sure09]), data management body of knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK [dama-dmbok]) or architecture frameworks and practices (e.g. TOGAF [togaf], Zachman Framework [zachman87], EAP [spewak06], etc.). Among other benefits of adopting a clear and well-defined methodology are: Clear lifecycle management Connection between model and expressed (business) requirements Implementation consistency Proper business requirements management (specifications, use cases, scenarios, competency questions, etc. are collected, edited, maintained, referred by the concepts) Title: Scope and goals definition Identifier MC-R2 Statement: A semantic data specification shall have clear goals and a well-established scope definition. Description: Establishing project scope ensures that the modelling work is focused and executed to expectations. It also helps define where the boundary of the model is and what shall be left out. The clearer the scope the higher chances of success are. It shall be possible to determine the scope of a data specification from the use cases for which it is drawn up. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.4] Title: Modularisation Identifier MC-R3 Statement: If a domain contains a lot of concepts that have to be modelled, then it is recommended to partition it into subdomains and manage them as connected modules. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] Description: Divide and conquer method works in many situations, including in the modelling realm. It may not be easy, however, to make a clearcut separation between concepts belonging to one module or another, and such an attempt will certainly bring clarity. Sometimes, a concept can be used for several domains. Then it shall be placed in a separate module. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] The need for modularisation typically emerges when the to-be-modelled space grows. As the terms are to be identified by URIs [PC-R2], it is recommended to include in the used URI structure modularisation potential. Examples: For example, in the eProcurement ontology(ePO) [epo], there is a core ontology and there are extension modules such as eCatalogue, eOrdering, and eNotice [epo] that further refine and extend a specific part of the core. For example, Core Location is used across other Core Vocabularies and is established as a CV on its own.","title":"Methodology conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"gc-methodology-conventions","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/gc-methodology-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Follow a methodology","hash":"sec:mc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Scope and goals definition","hash":"sec:mc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Modularisation","hash":"sec:mc-r3","id":3}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"Title: 5-star Linked Open Data Identifier PC-R1 Statement: Publishing data specifications shall be compliant with 5-star LOD criteria. Description: Publishing a vocabulary as a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource means making it accessible, both human and machine-readable, in a standard way, thus supporting the semantic web. The publication as full LOD implies that the data is compliant with the highest grade of 5-Star [5star-od] open data evaluation: The data is available on the Web under an open licence The data is available following a clear structure The data is available using a non-proprietary open format The data uses URIs to denote concepts The data is linked to other resources to provide context On the same note, the FAIR Data Principles [fair-principles] is a more comprehensive and rich set of guidelines for publishing data on the web. They ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data, as a result of the increase in volume, complexity and creation speed of data [fair-guidelines]. See more [ dwbp, ld-bp, ldp-bp ] Title: Persistent URI policy Identifier PC-R2 Statement: The URIs that are used to identify the terms modelled in the data specifications should be dereferenceable Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] and comply with a URI policy (or URI strategy). URIs that are well-defined according to such criteria are often denoted as PURIs [10rules-puri]. SEMIC adheres to the EU persistent URI policy. Each SEMIC URI is dereferenceable in both machine representation (RDF artefacts) and human-readable (HTML artefact). Description: When publishing data on the web [dwdp], it is crucial to have a structured and persistent system of URIs in place. Such URIs make it easy for the users to understand the vocabulary structure and retrieve information as they expect. The 10 rules for Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] are base principles for the design of quality identifiers. Regarding URI design, the main consideration of creators should be that when a URI is created, all its parts should be resistant to change. For instance, locations and organisation names can change and therefore should not be used in URIs. First and foremost, when introducing semantics in URIs, the strings used need to reflect what the resources are (i.e. intrinsic characteristics such as the type or nature), not who owns them or where they are [uri-dp]. In 2014, the ISA Programme devised a common policy for managing persistent HTTP-based URIs of EU institutions [uri-dp, 10rules-puri, puri-gov-eu]. That has led to an EU wide URI resolution service, prescribing that each URI is of the following pattern: http://data.europa.eu/{Collection}/{Reference} The {Collection} is an organisation-agnostic name for a collection of terms. Within a {Collection} the local names, or references, are being maintained according to the policy of the {Collection}. For SEMIC data specifications, the names are dependent on the naming conventions mentioned in this style guide rules [GC-R4 + CMC-R3]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, ] Examples: For example, the PURIs defined within the SEMIC Core Vocabularies are all within the {Collection} m8g. And thus the term Evidence in the context of CCCEV is denoted with the PURI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/Evidence. Title: Version management Identifier PC-R3 Statement: A consistent version management shall be implemented for the data specification evolution respecting the \"semantic versioning\" principles. Description: The SEMIC versioning methodology is based on \"semantic versioning\" principles [sem-ver] and implements a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. It involves describing clearly and precisely what is being published and which features are included, and what the limitations are, setting the expectations and scope. Once the artefacts are identified for the public, the changes to the data specifications are communicated with specific increments to the version number and with associated change notes. The version format is X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). As a rule of thumb, bug fixes do not affect the artefact and increment the Patch version. Backwards compatible artefact additions/changes increment the Minor version. And, backwards-incompatible artefact changes increment the Major version. Examples: For example, evolving from version 1.3.5 to 1.3.6 represents a backwards-compatible patch, from 1.3.5 to 1.4.0, a backwards-compatible new development, while switching from 1.3.5 to 2.0.0 breaks the backwards compatibility. Title: Artefact versioning Identifier PC-R4 Statement: The data specification shall be versioned as a whole and never to atomic elements (concepts, relations or constraints). Description: Create a new version with each publication. Using the semantic version principles to determine the exact version number depends on whether it is a major, minor or patch update. The version shall be assigned to the entire vocabulary or Application Profile and never to elements in the model (concepts, relations, constraints, etc.) [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.6]. The version shall be saved as the model metadata (for example, in the owl:Ontology header). No version information shall be embedded into any artefact URIs unless it is a version URI provided via owl:versionIRI. Title: URI dereferencing Identifier PC-R5 Statement: Any URI identifiable resource devised in a data specification shall be dereferenceable. Description: Dereferencing means that one can use the URI as an URL to retrieve related information back. The format and representation in which the information is returned depend on content negotiation. Content negotiation is the interaction between the client application and the server in which the client informs the server about its preferred format and representation and the server responds with the best-fitting result it can provide. It is recommended to provide (format) content negotiation for HTTP which is based on the interpretation of the Accept: HTTP header. The dereferencing shall be provided for both human-readable and machine-readable formats. A human-aimed HTML representation is the default response (if no content type is specified), and the other is RDF [10rules-puri]. Because the HTML representation is usally a long document, which makes it hard to find the information about a specific term, it is recommended that the HTML representation has landing points based on the used fragment identifier. Dereferencing can then route the reader to the most relevant information within the HTML document. For other representations/formats no additional requirements are imposed. For example, the dereferencing in the RDF representation, depends on the implemented recipe, i.e. based on # or /; and it may return either the corresponding fragment or the whole RDF document [pub-recipe]. Further technical details can be found in \"Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies\" [rdf-pub]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp ] Title: Human-readable form Identifier PC-R6 Statement: Each data specification shall have a corresponding human-readable form representing the model documentation. Description: The documentation content shall follow a standard template for consistent formatting and content structuring. It is a good practice to provide the following sections in the document: Preamble with metadata indicating Title Abstract Date of publication/release Version information Authors, editors, contributors Licensing information Introduction describing the Background information Context & Scope Intended audience UML diagrams of the model Description of each element in the model grouped by element type (e.g. class, property, constraint, controlled vocabulary). Each element shall be described by its URI and its Lexicalisation: URI (shall be clearly visible) Labels (preferred and alternative) Definitions, scope notes, examples, editorial notes, etc. Moreover, consider following the good practices for documenting OWL 2 and SHACL artefacts, and include the appropriate details in the data specification documentation. For OWL 2, we can mention tools like Widoco [widoco] and LODE [lode]; and for SHACL, follow the SHACL recommendation [shacl], or the metadata support implemented in tools such as SHACL-play [shacl-play]. For application profiles, consider aligning to the DCAP [dcap], which is an implementation agnostic recommendation.","title":"Publication conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"gc-publication-conventions","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/gc-publication-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"5-star Linked Open Data","hash":"sec:pc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Persistent URI policy","hash":"sec:pc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Version management","hash":"sec:pc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Artefact versioning","hash":"sec:pc-r4","id":4},{"text":"URI dereferencing","hash":"sec:pc-r5","id":5},{"text":"Human-readable form","hash":"sec:pc-r6","id":6}]},"69":{"id":69,"text":"Title: Formal language choice Identifier SC-R1 Statement: The formal ontology shall be expressed in OWL 2. Description: In the Semantic Web domain, two formal languages can be used for expressing the ontology: RDFS [rdfs] and OWL 2 [owl2]. RDFS is simpler and only allows for some of the recommended expressions (for example, the distinction between datatype and object properties is not possible). OWL 2 is more complex and more expressive than RDFS. We recommend using only a limited set of expression types available in OWL 2 language [SC-R2]. Examples: Core Vocabularies have an RDF representation as OWL 2 Ontology. In the example below, part of Core Person is depicted: @prefix dc: . @prefix foaf: . @prefix owl: . @prefix rdf: . @prefix rdfs: . @prefix schemas: . @prefix xsd: . a rdfs:Class; rdfs:label \"Person\"@en . a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; dc:mediator [ foaf:homepage ; foaf:name \"Semantic Interoperability Community (SEMIC)\" ]. Title: Limited (OWL 2) expressivity Identifier SC-R2 Statement: The formal ontology shall be lightweight in its logical underpinning, focusing mainly on the concept declarations, generalisation axioms and annotations. Description: OWL 2 language provides a high level of expressivity. In the SEMIC interoperability context, the primary purpose of semantic artefacts is to establish the common set of concepts and how they are employed in data exchange. For this purpose, simple OWL 2 constructs suffice. Therefore, the OWL 2 ontology shall be kept lightweight, and no advanced logical definitions are necessary, which would make the ontology heavyweight. The Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, dedicated an entire section on the charm of weak semantics in the linked data world. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. We recommend the formal ontology definition be limited to the following types of expressions: class declarations (owl:Class, rdfs:Class) data property declarations (owl:DatatypeProperty, rdf:Property) object property declarations (owl:ObjectProperty, rdf:Property) subclass relations (rdfs:subClassOf) subproperty relations (rdfs:subPropertyOf) annotations concept labels (rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel, skos:altLabel) concept definitions (rdfs:comment, skos:definition, skos:scopeNote) notes and comments (rdfs:comment, skos:editorialNote, skos:changeNote, skos:historyNote, skos:example) ontology header with import statements (owl:import) version metadata (owl:versionInfo, owl:versionIRI) provenance metadata (e.g. dct:issued, adms:status) descriptive metadata The formal ontology shall not include other types of statements unless justified as necessary. The properties used, in particular those related to the ontology header, shall be aligned with the governance process. No expressions of (a) property domain specification (rdfs:domain) and (b) property range specification (rdfs:range) shall be used unless justified as absolutely necessary. The need for setting property domain and range constraints is better fulfilled by the data shapes expressed in SHACL language. Keeping the ontology lightweight allows the maximum freedom for reuse (e.g. in different application profiles, where domains/ranges can be specified or restricted), and does not interfere with the validation concerns covered by the data shapes. Note: This recommendation does not prevent the generation of more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity), as additional artefacts that would be included in the data specification. A data specification could even provide several such ontology versions, one for each OWL 2 profiles (EL/QL/RL), for example, if there are well-defined use cases identified for them. However, if such additional ontologies will be provided as part of the data specification, it is essential that they are all be kept consistent with all the other artefacts (including the lightweight ontology, the human-readable version, etc.) (see section on Transformation). Therefore, it is highly recommended having appropriate tool support, which enables the automatic generation of all the ontologies that are needed from the conceptual model. Regardless of how many ontology versions will be generated and published as part of the data specification, the most important thing, and hence the main point of this recommendation, is that there should always be at least one lightweight ontology, to support a highest level of interoperability and reuse. Often, this is called the \"core\" ontology, in data specifications that provide multiple ontology versions, while the other, more expressive, ontology versions have different names. Examples: For example, consider the (shortened) DCAT-AP imports header: rdf:type owl:Ontology ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports . Or consider, the (shortened) Core Person vocabulary header: a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; Title: Lexicalisation Identifier SC-R3 Statement: The choice in handling the lexicalisation of concepts shall be clearly defined and consistently implemented. Description: The lexicalisation of concepts in semantic artefacts can be implemented in multiple ways. Two popular approaches are used in practice: RDFS or SKOS lexicalisation. However, other types can be considered as well (e.g. [lemon], [vann], etc.). RDFS allows for a simple lexicalisation and annotation: labels rdfs:label may be used to provide a human-readable version of a resource’s name. comments rdfs:comment may be used to provide a human-readable description of a resource. SKOS offers a richer and more elaborate lexicalisation and annotation: Lexical labels skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel are useful when generating or creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organisation system. These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS concept. skos:hiddenLabel has a more technical nature and may be useful when a user is interacting with a knowledge organisation system via a text-based search function. The user may, for example, enter misspelled words when trying to find a relevant concept. Documentation properties skos:definition supplies a complete explanation of the intended meaning of a concept; skos:scopeNote supplies some, possibly partial, information about the intended meaning of a concept, especially as an indication of how the use of a concept is limited in indexing practice; skos:note useful for general documentation purposes; skos:example supplies an example of the use of a concept; skos:historyNote describes significant changes to the meaning or the form of a concept; skos:changeNote documents fine-grained changes to a concept, for the purposes of administration and maintenance; skos:editorialNote supplies information that is an aid to administrative housekeeping, such as reminders of editorial work still to be done, or warnings in the event that future editorial changes might be made. We recommend one, or the other is used. Both can be used at the same time without any consequence of semantics, but this will introduce redundancy and possibly a maintenance burden. Examples: For example, in Core Person Vocabulary RDFS lexicalisation is used: a rdf:Property; rdfs:label \"date of birth\"@en . For example in ePO, both lexicalisations are provided (even if this may be considered redundant): :Term a owl:Class ; rdfs:label \"Term\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; rdfs:isDefinedBy ; skos:definition \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; skos:prefLabel \"Term\"@en . Title: Reasoning assumption Identifier SC-R4 Statement: No reasoning capabilities shall be assumed. Description: OWL 2 constructs correspond to Description Logic (DL) concepts (direct semantics). Logic, besides expressing knowledge in a knowledge base, can be used to perform automated reasoning, i.e., inferring new knowledge based on premises and reasoning rules. The inference is also possible with RDF-based semantics, based on translating the axioms into directed graphs. The latter is used for SPARQL entailments and SHACL data shape rules. Automated reasoning is not consistently available across environments: small differences in the usage context or reasoning patterns may lead to different outcomes. Therefore, the editors of interoperable semantic data specifications are strongly recommended to NOT rely on such capabilities. Thus, in practice, the model shall allow for an explicit statement of the intended knowledge, and as little as possible shall be left implicit. Title: Circular definitions Identifier SC-R5 Statement: The data specification (semantic, conceptual, or shape) shall not use circular definitions. Description: Circular definition, i.e., definitions that use the element they define are incorrect. For instance, we say that an ontology element (a class, an object property or a data property) is circular when used in its own definition. This can occur in situations such as the following: (a) the definition of a class as the enumeration of several classes including itself; (b) the appearance of a class within its owl:equivalentClass or rdfs:subClassOf axioms; (c) the appearance of an object property in its rdfs:domain or rdfs:range definitions; or (d) the appearance of a data property in its rdfs:domain definition.","title":"Semantic conventions","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"gc-semantic-conventions","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/gc-semantic-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Formal language choice","hash":"sec:sc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Limited (OWL 2) expressivity","hash":"sec:sc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Lexicalisation","hash":"sec:sc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Reasoning assumption","hash":"sec:sc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Circular definitions","hash":"sec:sc-r5","id":5}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"This section provides a series of guidelines and conventions for developing and publishing a Core Vocabulary or an Application Profile.

This style guide may constitute a good source of information and explanations for the European Commission’s officers, collaborating consultants, and stakeholders involved in inter-institutional standardisation. The main purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance and decision-making support for the creators, maintainers and publishers of the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. In the context of European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif] this style guide primarily addresses the Semantic Interoperability layer. The main part of this document is organised as a series of self-contained rules and guidelines. In the scope of this document are included: a terminological clarification for the significant SEMIC terms (including \"reuse\", \"ontology\", \"Core Vocabulary\", etc.); an architecture overview, which interconnects various aspects and data specification types and how they are derived from a single conceptual model; the concept of \"reuse\" in great detail and pinpoints exactly what is permitted and what is not permitted in the SEMIC context; recommendations on organising the conceptual model, the semantic artefacts, and the data shapes; some recommendations on the specification development methodology and some publication conventions. It is considered out of the scope of this document to provide: a complete and specific modelling methodology, a procedure for maintenance and publication, governance (roles, processes, responsibilities, etc.), lifecycle and release management methodology (including the initiation and change requests), any specific implementation instructions, indications as to what set of tools shall be adopted, specifications related to data serialisation, formats or any syntax mapping methods (including syntax binding instructions to for example XSD/XML; or JSON-LD contexts), usage instructions for the end users. This style guide is recommended to be used in combination with complementary documents, among which we consider relevant, but not limited to, the following ones: the user manual of a transformation tool from UML into other representations explaining what transformation rules are supported (i.e. implemented by the tool), the documentation (manuals, handbooks, specifications) of the reused data specifications, the governance and methodology documentation of the organisation developing the new semantic data specification, the adopted URI policy documentation, which can be inter-institutional policy or organisation specific one [10rules-puri]. This document is organised in two parts. The first part provides a brief context description and scope and offers an architectural overview. It introduces important terminological clarifications, the benefits of adopting the separation of concerns principle, and explanations of how it is played out in the SEMIC context. The second part of the document provides a series of guidelines, conventions and assumption specifications. These guidelines are organised according to the aspects they cover. A guideline is a stand-alone description containing an indicative statement and a detailed description providing the rationale, benefits and limitations, implications and practical requirements, and eventually examples. Users who may choose to bypass introductory details may decide to proceed with reading the general guidelines and the ones on the conceptual model first.","title":"Introduction","component":"style-guide","version":"SM16-17","name":"introduction","url":"/style-guide/SM16-17/introduction.html","titles":[{"text":"Target audience","hash":"sec:target-audience","id":1},{"text":"Scope","hash":"sec:scope","id":2},{"text":"How to read this document","hash":"sec:how-to-read","id":3}]},"74":{"id":74,"text":"[10rules-puri] Codreanu, D.

References This document defines the style guide to be applied to the SEMIC’s semantic data specifications, notably to the eGovernment Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. It provides rules on naming conventions, syntax, artefact management and organisation. It is meant to be complemented with technical artefacts and implementations that enable automatic conformance checking and transformation of conceptual models into formal semantic representations. The content of these guides is part of the action to promote semantic interoperability amongst the EU Member States, with the objective of fostering the use of standards by, for example, offering guidelines and expert advice on semantic interoperability for public administrations. This style guide is intended primarily for semantic engineers, data architects and knowledge modelling specialists who are acting as editors or reusers of Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. This style guide may constitute a good source of information and explanations for the European Commission’s officers, collaborating consultants, and stakeholders involved in inter-institutional standardisation. The main purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance and decision-making support for the creators, maintainers and publishers of the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. In the context of European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif] this style guide primarily addresses the Semantic Interoperability layer. The main part of this document is organised as a series of self-contained rules and guidelines. In the scope of this document are included: a terminological clarification for the significant SEMIC terms (including \"reuse\", \"ontology\", \"Core Vocabulary\", etc.); an architecture overview, which interconnects various aspects and data specification types and how they are derived from a single conceptual model; the concept of \"reuse\" in great detail and pinpoints exactly what is permitted and what is not permitted in the SEMIC context; recommendations on organising the conceptual model, the semantic artefacts, and the data shapes; some recommendations on the specification development methodology and some publication conventions. It is considered out of the scope of this document to provide: a complete and specific modelling methodology, a procedure for maintenance and publication, governance (roles, processes, responsibilities, etc.), lifecycle and release management methodology (including the initiation and change requests), any specific implementation instructions, indications as to what set of tools shall be adopted, specifications related to data serialisation, formats or any syntax mapping methods (including syntax binding instructions to for example XSD/XML; or JSON-LD contexts), usage instructions for the end users. This style guide is recommended to be used in combination with complementary documents, among which we consider relevant, but not limited to, the following ones: the user manual of a transformation tool from UML into other representations explaining what transformation rules are supported (i.e. implemented by the tool), the documentation (manuals, handbooks, specifications) of the reused data specifications, the governance and methodology documentation of the organisation developing the new semantic data specification, the adopted URI policy documentation, which can be inter-institutional policy or organisation specific one [10rules-puri]. This document is organised in two parts. The first part provides a brief context description and scope and offers an architectural overview. It introduces important terminological clarifications, the benefits of adopting the separation of concerns principle, and explanations of how it is played out in the SEMIC context. The second part of the document provides a series of guidelines, conventions and assumption specifications. These guidelines are organised according to the aspects they cover. A guideline is a stand-alone description containing an indicative statement and a detailed description providing the rationale, benefits and limitations, implications and practical requirements, and eventually examples. Users who may choose to bypass introductory details may decide to proceed with reading the general guidelines and the ones on the conceptual model first. Before detailed definitions and explanations are provided, let’s align on the idea that \"semantic data specifications comprise artefacts\". There are semantic data specifications. They comprise nothing else but a collection of terms, structure and rule specifications on how to combine these terms and (RE)use expectations. In the SEMIC context, a semantic data specification can be either: a Core Vocabulary, or an Application Profile There are Artefacts. They encode or indicate a representation format, attend a need or specific purpose, and address a clear concern. In the SEMIC context, we acknowledge, but not limited to, the following list of artefacts: Persistent URIs OWL 2 representation SHACL representation HTML representation Pictures/Diagrams UML representation JSON-LD representation (+ JSON schema) XML representation (+ XSD schema) …​ Note that not all artefacts are treated in the current style-guide, but only the ones that are in scope of the Semantic Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif]. Definition A conceptual model, also referred to as conceptual model specification, is an abstract representation of a system and comprises well-defined concepts, their qualities or attributes, and their relationships to other concepts. A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. Description A conceptual model is a representation of a system that uses concepts to form said representation. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well named by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. The conceptual model comprises representations of concepts, their qualities or attributes and relationships to other concepts. Most commonly, these are association and generalisation relations. In addition, the conceptual model can be materialised in a graphical representation facilitating knowledge elicitation, organisation and interaction with domain experts. This is relevant because interactions and discussions within a Working Group for a data specification are often driven by a graphical representation. However, the need for a conceptual model and a visual representation shall not be conflated. Thus, we keep clear separation of concerns, which is addressed in detailed in the next section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. There is no perfect candidate for representing the conceptual model. And, although not without limitations, risks for misunderstandings and mis-interpretations, we choose (a subset of) UML language [epo-cm2owl] as most appropriate and instrumental in addressing (a) the concern for having a conceptual model established and (b) the concern for providing a graphical representation. The UML appropriateness has been acknowledged based on a longstanding experience and practices. An entire section of this style guide is dedicated to (UML) conceptual model [see Conceptual model conventions]. The subset of the UML language considered in this style guide is comprised (but not limited to) in the following set of UML elements: Class Class Attribute Connector Association Dependency Generalisation Enumeration For visual representation only UML Class Diagrams are considered. Note: UML will be the recommended language for defining the conceptual models until a better and more appropriate alternative with robust tool support is developed, that is also addressing the SEMIC methods and practices [see Architectural clarification]. Definition An ontology, also referred to as ontology specification, is a a formal specification describing the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents (e.g. domain experts) [gruber93]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse [wiki-onto]. Description The ontology constitutes the formal (machine-readable) definition of concepts. Although the languages for expressing ontologies vary in expressivity, we shall keep it light and simple, from the formal point of view, with minimal detail and level of expressivity [SC-R2]. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. In the SEMIC context, we only consider lightweight ontologies [defined in rule SC-R2]. Therefore, even if this aspect is not emphasised as \"lightweight ontology\", it is implicitly meant even when simple \"ontology\" reference is used. We assume that the ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language [SC-R1]. The main purpose of this component is to declare the classes, properties, datatypes and controlled lists. Each construct is established by assigning a URI and decorating it with human-readable labels and descriptions, and constitutes the mechanism to establish common references for humans and machines. Definition A data shape specification, also referred to as data shape constraint specification, or simply as data shape constraint or data shape, provides a set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated. Description The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language. This document will refer to data shape constraint specifications simply as \"data shapes\", but occasionally also as \"data shape constraints\" or \"data shape specifications\". Definition A data specification document, also referred to as specification document, is the human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape, or a combination of both. Description A data specification document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to understand (a) how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain, and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose. It is to serve as technical documentation for anyone interested in using (e.g. adopting or extending) a semantic data specification (see [What is a semantic data specification?]). We assume that the data specification documents are published in HTML format (optionally, others). See, for example, the Core Person specification [cpv] or the CPSV-AP specification [cpsv-ap]. Definition A data specification artefact, often referred to as specification artefact or simply artefact, is a materialisation of a semantic data specification in a concrete representation that is appropriate for addressing one or more concerns (e.g. use cases, requirements). Description In the SEMIC context, we consider the following artefact types as primary: ontologies, data shapes, and specification documents. For a description of various concerns addressed in the SEMIC context, please see the section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. Additionally, we are concerned with syntax bindings and serialisation formats (XML/XSD and JSON-LD in particular). Still, these are not in the scope of this document and are addressed elsewhere. For more, see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. Definition A semantic data specification , often called simply data specification, is a union of machine- and human-readable artefacts addressing clearly defined concerns, interoperability scope and use-cases. A semantic data specification comprises at least an ontology and a data shape (or either of them individually) accompanied by a human-readable data specification. Description One general categorisation of semantic data specifications is along the reuse axis. Some semantic data specifications are built with the intent that the terms of the conceptual model can be used in as much as possible contexts. Typically, it is possible to use the terms independently of each other. In this case, the definitions of the terms are usually very broad and abstract, and only the bare minimum of (usage) constraints are expressed. Often, the terms are presented as a list to the reader, with identifiers for each term in the same namespace. Those semantic data specifications are usually denoted with terms such as vocabularies or terminology. On the other side of the spectrum are the data specifications that precisely encode the semantics of the conceptual model that is being used in a single data exchange context, implemented in software or API. They usually have a strong connection with technical data representations (see section on [Technical artefacts and concerns]) and documentations such as XSD schema, OpenAPI specifications, etc. Conceptual models for this purpose will contain precise constraints, technical datatypes, the code-lists that are being used, refer to implementation decisions, etc. Semantic data specifications that are created for that purpose are denoted with Implementation Models. As that name indicate, their objective is to encode the conceptual model of an implementation. Between those two extremes, i.e. contextfree reuse (vocabularies) and unique usage context (Implementation Models), there are semantic data specifications that aim to capture the conceptual model for a broad, yet well-defined, usage context. Typically, these data specifications do not intend to introduce new terms in the conceptual model, but will exploit terms from other semantic data specifications. These exploited terms are augmented with additional usage constraints making the terms more fit for purpose. These semantic data specifications are often denoted with terms such as Application Profiles or Profiles. Readers should understand that the usage relationships between semantic data specifications form a complex network. An attempt to provide a structured view on this network was initiated in the draft W3C Profile Guide [profile-guide]. Also, the Application Profiles do not necessarily have to address all the technical needs related to an implemented system. Distinction between technical and semantic interoperability layers is attempted in this section. This categorisation along the reuse axis indicates the importance of expressing the interoperability scope for semantic data specifications. However, due to the absence of widely accepted definitions for those categories, outlining the exact Dos and Don’ts (for each category), may result to different expectations for each category. This style guide is a document that defines the commonly accepted and applied rules for SEMIC. In the SEMIC context, two types of semantic data specifications are considered: [Core Vocabulary] and [Application Profile]. Semantic data specifications of the third category, Implementation Models, are not part of the activities of SEMIC. Nevertheless, their existence, is taken into account when building the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. Occasionally, this document will refer to semantic data specifications shortly as \"data specifications\". With a similar meaning, the term \"semantic asset\" is used in the literature (e.g. ADMS [adms]). However, in our understanding, the term \"semantic asset\" is broader than \"data specification\" and includes controlled vocabularies and possibly other types of assets. Definition A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable and extensible data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context. Broad context (on vocabularies) On the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as \"terms\") used to describe and represent an area of concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular application, characterise possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only) [vocab]. There is no clear division between what is referred to as \"vocabulary\" and \"ontology\". The trend is to use the word \"ontology\" for a more complex and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas \"vocabulary\" is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or used only in a very loose sense [vocab]. SEMIC context (on Core Vocabularies) Formally, a Core Vocabulary encompasses a lightweight ontology, and, optionally, a (permissive) data shape specification, and it is expressed in a condensed, comprehensive data specification document. CV = lightweight ontology + (optionally) a (permissive) data shape For more details see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. The qualifications lightweight and permissive are used to better emphasise the intention to be reused in the broadest possible context. More precise boundaries are defined further in this document. NOTE: \"Vocabularies\", in general, are not the same as \"controlled vocabularies\", as the latter usually refers to SKOS artefacts. However, in other contexts (similar to SEMIC), a Core Vocabulary might often be simply denoted as \"vocabulary\". Definition An Application Profile is a data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context. It re-uses concepts from one or more semantic data specifications, while adding more specificity, by identifying mandatory, recommended, and optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and providing recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used [dcat-ap]. Description An Application Profile (AP) is a data shape specification which addresses particular application needs (operating within some domain or community) while providing semantic interoperability with other applications based on one or more shared ontologies (vocabularies) [dc-ap]. Formally, the Application Profile encompasses (a) reused ontology specifications (one or many) and (b) its own data shape specification. Optionally it may include (c) reused data shape specifications (one or many), and (d) it may provide its own ontology specification to fill the ontological gaps. AP = reused lightweight ontology + own data shape + (optionally) reused (permissive) data shape + (optionally) own ontology SEMIC context In SEMIC, Application Profiles encompass an ontology, which is largely composed of importing the reused ontologies, complemented with an appropriate data shape specification. Terms that are introduced because of the Application Profile needs are, by preference, added to existing Core Vocabularies. If this is not possible, an Application Profile-specific Vocabulary is created. AP = reused Core Vocabulary + own data shape + (optionally) own ontology The data specification document of an Application Profile is elaborated. It provides the application scope and context, and documents the ontology and the data shapes through the conceptual model. It also provides additional information that stimulates the adoption and correct usage of the AP in implementations. The consumers of SEMIC standards specification can be divided into three categories: business users and domain experts, technicians, software engineers, and software architects, the developers software systems implementing the standards, the machines The SEMIC goal is to bring these groups together, help them \"speak the same language\" and share meaning and conceptual references. Besides the very useful and much needed alignment of domains experts on what concepts mean, it is necessary to bridge the gap between domain experts and the technical experts who implement information systems. Then, the domain experts and business users shall interact with the information systems using the very same set of concepts, agnostic to and undistorted by the technology in the implementation process. Standard semantic data specifications fulfil the purpose keeping these three groups in sync. Ultimately, if the systems are based on standards the purpose is to build interoperable machines - machines that share data with each other and are able to operate on them seamlessly. The developers implement those machine interactions, and therefore the machines and developers must \"find a common language\". However, in order to ensure that the developers take the appropriate steps, the business/domain experts have to interact with them and convey their domain knowledge. This closes the loop: that the machine interactions correspond with the business/domain expert expectations. The data specification shall address the following information needs: visual representation, textual description, machine interpretable representation, and optionally additional representations that facilitate and promote adoption. The aim of this style guide is to ensure the creation of coherent data specifications that can be read and used by domain experts, developers and machines. It is mainly meant for the editors of the data specifications (e.g. semantic engineers, data architects, knowledge modelling specialists). Such data specifications are primarily developed in collaboration with domain experts. To achieve synergy with the domain experts, graphical representation is an indispensable medium that facilitates knowledge elicitation, ideation and knowledge organisation. This becomes especially relevant when shared conceptualisation needs to be attained within a Working Group. The successful application of an ontology or the development of an ontology-based system depends not merely on building a good ontology but also on fitting this into an appropriate development process and implementation into an information system. Generally, computing information models suffer from the intertwining of two types of semantic concerns. As George Box said, \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\", and what a model is useful for depends on what concern it is primarily addressing. On the one hand, the model represents (purely) the domain; on the other hand, it represents the implemented system, which encompasses a representation of the domain (domain knowledge intertwined with technical specificities). These different representation requirements place different demands upon its structure [partridge13]. For example, the concept of \"location\" can be described by domain experts (in a domain model) in a way that is not isomorphic to how the \"location\" class may be appropriately modelled for an information system (i.e., captured in an Implementation Model). One of the common ways to manage this problem is by separating concerns. We take inspiration from OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [mda], which is a well-documented structure where a model is built for each concern, which is transformed into a different model for a different concern. This approach is adapted to the SEMIC needs. Transformation deals with producing different models, viewpoints, or artefacts from a model based on a transformation pattern. In general, transformation can produce one representation from another or cross levels of abstraction or architectural layers [mda-guide]. The Core Vocabularies (CVs) and the specialised Application Profiles (APs) aim to address the following concerns: Domain experts need to agree on the definitions of concepts, relations and their organisation to form a coherent domain model expressed with varying levels of details and expressivity [SC-R2], a shared conceptualisation. This is addressed with conceptual models expressed in UML. The shared conceptualisation needs to be explicitly represented in a usable format (i.e. operated on) by the machines. This is addressed with lightweight ontologies expressed in OWL 2. In practice, to achieve interoperability, it is necessary to provide a (minimum and necessary) set of constraints supporting the ontology instantiation. This is addressed with data shapes expressed in SHACL. To facilitate reuse and understanding, a specification shall be accessible to the community as clear, complete and well-articulated documentation. This is addressed with data specification documents expressed in HTML. In addition, when multiple artefacts addressing each concern are produced, keeping them in synch is a serious editorial and maintenance burden that needs to be considered. On the editorial side the artefacts composing a data specification need to be kept in sync. A modification done in one shall pervade and propagate in all others. This is a difficult, tedious and expensive activity if such synchronisation is to be done manually. Experience shows that using a pivot representation as a single source of truth is a viable solution. Such representation needs to be expressive enough to fulfill all the information needs of the derived artefacts. UML conceptual models can be used as the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. This means it is sufficiently expressive to capture multiple modelling aspects/concerns simultaneously. The other artefacts are then fully or partially derived from the conceptual model. With UML as the single source of truth, the update process is easier to perform as it only has to be done in a single place. The other representations are automatically derived from the conceptual model; the maintenance is less error-prone, uniform and easy [Transformation]. This approach facilitates consistent maintenance of semantic data specification interrelationship and solves the editorial synchronisation problem. However, using UML is not enough, by itself, as the risk of ambiguity and multiple interpretations of the meaning of the UML model elements used in the conceptual model still exists. This risk is mitigated by adopting precise interpretation rules, such as the ones provided in this style guide [CMC-R2]. The different concerns that each data specification is trying to address might lead to different interpretations of the same UML constructs. Therefore, [CMC-R2] defines only a minimal set of such interpretation rules (that can be further extended, if necessary). Additionally, UML cannot cover all potential needs specific to each derived representation. Therefore, the scope of this architecture is limited by what can be expressed in UML and how that information is utilised to generate formal statements. But from our experience it is sufficient to cover all the needs of establishing semantic interoperability standards. Relations between the artefacts are depicted in the figure above. The conceptual model is the source from which a) the data shapes, b) the formal ontology and c) the data specification document can be generated. Each artefact in the figure is qualified with two terms, the representation standard and the most characteristic feature. The conceptual model is expressed in UML language and shall be conformant with the conventions provided in this style guide and the interpretation rules [CMC-R2]. The formal ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language and shall be lightweight as indicated in this convention [SC-R2]. The data shape is expressed in SHACL language and is characterised by the appropriate level of permissiveness [DSC-R2]. The documentation is represented in HTML format and the wording used shall be as precise as possible to capture the meaning accurately and clearly express the intention of the authors. Although not shown in this diagram, the generation of other artefacts is not excluded. For example, more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity) can also be included in the data specification as additional artefacts (see note on [SC-R2]). The figure above depicts that it is also possible to derive from the conceptual model additional artefacts, such as the XSD or JSON schemas and JSON-LD context definitions. These, however, are not addressed in this style guide. One condition the conceptual model shall satisfy is that it shall comply with a set of pre-established conventions (general conventions and UML conventions) and have a fixed interpretation [CMC-R2]. The guidelines in this document enable and constrain the transformation process, making it precise enough to implement a toolchain that automatically performs conformance checking and necessary transformation operations. How this is done, however, is beyond the scope of this document, and the reader may refer to SEMIC toolchain [semic] or other similar implementations such as model2owl [model2owl] or OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain] projects. For any given data specification, various concerns shall be addressed separately, each in a dedicated artefact type. Therefore, the CVs or APs shall be published as a set of artefacts, each addressing a specific concern. The union of these artefacts forms the intended semantic data specification [What is a semantic data specification?]. The table below summarises which artefacts shall be published for each type of data specification addressed in the SEMIC context. Conceptual model (UML) Ontology (OWL 2) Data shape (SHACL) Specification document (HTML) Model diagram (PNG) Core Vocabulary Mandatory Mandatory Optional (shall be permissive) Mandatory Optional (recommended) Application Profile Mandatory Optional (shall be an extension) Mandatory Mandatory Optional (recommended) The semantic data specifications, both CVs and APs, are conceived as a union of specification artefacts, each addressing a different aspect/concern: conceptual model expressed in UML formal ontology expressed in OWL 2 data shapes expressed in SHACL data specification document realised in HTML conceptual model diagrams expressed in any image format (PNG, for example) In the SEMIC context two types of data specifications are of main concern (a) Core Vocabularies designed with broad interoperability goals and (b) Application Profiles designed with application oriented interoperability goals. In this document, we will refer to these data specification types to provide guideline refinements depicting variations based on the data specification type. The primary concern and the intention in each of them differ as follows: Core Vocabularies aim at establishing the shared vocabulary as a lightweight ontology essentially, and optionally some data shapes if necessary [Core Vocabulary]. Application Profiles aim at setting carefully designed data shapes on reused concepts from one or several existent ontologies and, optionally, a minimal ontology with specialised vocabulary [Application Profile]. The secondary concerns are present and common in both data specification types and are, in fact, instrumental to consistent production, maintenance and publication: Editing of the conceptual model Production of data specification document The data specification’s artefacts are not independent but tightly interrelated and transformed from one form into another one. It is difficult to draw a clear line between semantic and technical interoperability artefacts and concerns. This section aims at providing some guidelines and hints on how to distinguish between the two (but no guidelines on technical artefacts are considered as this is out of scope of this work). The best way to look at them is in terms of concerns addressed within each layer, which resembles a lot the discussion on distinguishing \"Conceptual Data Models\", \"Logical Data Models\" and \"Physical Data Models\" in ANSI [ansi] from 1975. EIF [eif] defines the technical interoperability as covering the applications and infrastructures linking systems and services. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to: interface specifications, interconnection services, data integration services, data presentation and exchange, secure communication protocols, access boundaries, information boundaries, etc. The technical layer deals with how to represent, how to transmit data, how the data/entities are bundled when served by a service (i.e. API design or transmission, with impact on performance, usability, and interface), what are the access rights, how is the security ensured, access and storage performance, interfacing with the service, usability, etc. EIF defines the semantic interoperability as ensuring that precise (format and) meaning of exchanged data and information is understood throughout exchanges between parties: \"what is sent is what is understood\". It covers two aspects: semantic and syntactic. The semantic aspect refers to the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them. The syntactic aspect refers to describing the exact format of the information to be exchanged in terms of grammar and format. The concerns considered in this layer are related, but not limited, to developing vocabularies and define data meaning in exchanges. This layer is agnostic to access right, security, transmission protocol, physical representation, how it is presented to the user, etc. In the SEMIC context, Semantic Web and Linked Data technology standards are chosen by default. This means that the syntactic aspect is covered by the RDF specifications [rdf], whereas the semantic aspect is addressed within the Core Vocabulary and Application Profile, expressed in OWL 2 [owl2] and SHACL [shacl] languages. Connecting the semantic layer and the technical layers may not always be straightforward. Three types of technical artefacts are of a particular importance, which rely on three different technologies: XML and XSD, JSON and JSON schema, and relational databases. We briefly comment on each below. RDF. In case the system is gnostic of Semantic Web technologies, if the implementation uses RDF natively, then the technical layer is (near) isomorphic to the semantic specification. There is a perfect alignment. JSON. When system implementation is based on JSON representations, a mapping shall be provided to establish semantics-syntax alignment. Luckily, how such an alignment is done is already specified in the JSON-LD standard specification [json-ld]. It contains a canonical mapping algorithm. The syntaxt semantic binding is provided by the so-called context definitions. As a consequence, if the JSON structure is ought to be aligned with the semantic specification, it imposes a strong constraint on how it shall be organised, otherwise the mapping is not possible. So, an advantage of JSON-LD is that the semantics gets coupled nicely with the syntax, and it is in the reach of the developer. XML. When the system implementation is based on XML representation, then the interplay between syntax and semantics is more problematic, as there is NO canonical way os linking the two. The only transformation we have is the XSLT [xslt] but no mapping language exists like in the case of JSON-LD. Hence, if one provides a mapping to an XSD schema, then one must also provide the XSLT specification that interprets that mapping. Furthermore, when we want to establish an alignment between syntax and semantics there is no constraint on the structure (like in the case of JSON). It is only good practices and alternative technologies, such as RML, that we can rely on in this case. [rml]. RDB. If the implementation is based on relational databases, the story is similar to the XML. There is no organic way of mapping syntax and semantics. The mapping is at the level of the database schema, and there is no canonical way of doing this. So, just like in the case of XML we rely on good practices and alternative technologies to encode an interpretation, such as D2RML [d2rm] and RML [rml]. Ideally, syntax-binding artefacts that show how to map from a semantic data specification into technical layer artefacts is also provided as part of the specification. Showing how to interface with the semantic layer is especially important when Application Profiles (and Implementation Model specifications) are developed and published. In the Semantic Web literature, the term \"reuse\" appears very often, encouraging the adoption of data specifications in new data specifications rather than redefining the same/similar concepts once again. The term \"reuse\" is usually considered in a broad sense, and what it means in terms of specific implementations is often left underspecified. In this section, we aim to address this gap and provide a detailed account of what \"reuse\" means in the SEMIC context. Specification reuse is the act of sourcing an established specification into a new one (referred to as the \"current\" or \"own\" specification). Technically, reuse may mean either or both of the following: Importing (using owl:imports) the contents of another ontology or data shape specification into a current one; OR relying on URI dereferencing to get the formal definition of the ontology (this, however, does not work for the data shapes) In the SEMIC context, for the purpose of interoperability, we need to carefully constrain the meaning of the term \"reuse\" with a fine-grained description on a construct-by-construct basis, and this is the aim of the remainder of this section. The following subsections offer a systematic description of six cases of reuse based on what is reused: (a) a class or (b) a property, and types of frequently encountered variations: (i) as-is, (ii) with terminological adaptations, and (iii) with semantic adaptations. In each case, we describe as appropriate the implications on the following aspects: How to denote it: (a) as-is or (b) as a specialisation Label Definition Impact of adding new properties (for classes only) Impact of reusing original properties (for classes only) Impact on domain and range (for properties only) Other constraints and additional information This scenario applies when the original class is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed New properties on the class In data shapes (SHACL), the class can be used for in domain/range property constraints. In UML, properties are depicted as new connections (object properties) that are incoming and outgoing to the class or as new attributes (data properties) that appear in the class. This works because OWL 2 semantics treats properties as first-class citizens (along with classes, datatypes and individuals). So even if the UML class diagram may visualise new properties on the class, they shall be read as constructs defined separately from one another, just as the OWL 2 specification defines it [owl2]. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Also, make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification In OWL 2 & SHACL, when reusing a class as-is from an established ontology hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class are considered adopted (even if some may be irrelevant). It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In UML, all properties marked as mandatory in the original data specification are considered relevant and shall be depicted. Optional properties may be depicted only if relevant in the new context. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for reuse. This scenario applies when the original class is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Reuse as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-class that captures the adaptations is recommended as the safe option. Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics must stay the same. Differentiation through using preferred and alternative labels is a strong recommendation and should be implemented as described below. In UML, - the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) - the (original) URI of the reused class shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) - the original label of the reused concept shall be preserved (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, - the original label is adopted as is (e.g. either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) - the new label is added as an alternative label (e.g. skos:altLabel) In the documentation, - the new label displayed as the main label (in titles and any other fronting) - the original label (to be visibly mentioned) Definition NO change allowed Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g. skos:scopeNote). New properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Original properties on the class Same recommendation as for reusing the class as-is Example For example, the wording of FOAF definitions can benefit from light adaptations and adjustments, yet the meaning is not changing. Hence, in Core Person Vocabulary, the definitions are slightly adjusted. Such adaptations might be made when the original label or definition does not follow the guidelines laid out in this document. For example, the one on circular definitions [GC-R5]. This scenario applies when the original class is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Must reuse as a specialisation. Must create a subclass that captures the adaptations and indicate reuse by the subclass relationship. If the reused class is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused class Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the reused class New properties on the class Add new properties as necessary on the new (owned) sub-class. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited. When introducing new properties, do not duplicate existing ones in the superclass(es). Make sure there are no logical contradictions [CS-R5]. Original properties on the class as defined in the context of a data specification When reusing a class as-is from a data specification, hereafter called the original, all properties and constraints associated with the class should be adopted. In UML, include all properties and constraints in the UML diagram if marked as mandatory in the original. For the sake of brevity, optional properties and constraints can be omitted. The properties on the superclasses of the reused class are considered inherited and may be depicted in the UML diagram as necessary for the purpose of reuse. If a reused original property must be made more specific or nuanced, then it is a good idea to create a sub-property of the already existing one. See property reuse recommendations below. Example For example, in the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary, the reused class org:Organisation is specialised as cv:PublicOrganisation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without terminological or semantic changes. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. Label NO change allowed Definition NO change allowed Domain and range If the reused property * does not define a domain and range (in the original ontology) AND * its definition does NOT mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape) then it can be attached in UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) to any class either as a) a relation (pointing to another class) or b) as an attribute with a specific datatype. If the reused property * defines a domain and range (in the original ontology) OR * its definition DOES mention explicit restrictions on the domain and range (in the data shape), then it must be reflected in the UML diagrams (in the owned data specification) accordingly, i.e. it can be applied only on specified classes. When UML is transformed into other representations, it is not recommended to represent the domain/range definitions in the lightweight ontology (OWL 2). Still, it may be reflected in data shape definitions (SHACL) as constraints. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocs, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but better reflect them as constraints in SHACL, where necessary (i.e. optional properties can stay free of domain/range specification) [CS-R2]. Note: in the case of narrow reuse intention, as for the application profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range constraints in the data shape definitions (using SHACL) even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information When reusing a property as-is from a data specification, then all constraints associated with the property should be adopted. It is recommended to make the reuse of the original clear (by notes, hyperlinks or dereferenceable URIs of the terms) at the class level. In no way should the UML contain conflicting constraints compared to the original data specification. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. This scenario applies when the original property is reused without semantic changes. Still, a label or definition needs to be modified to reflect the meaning in the new context accurately. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Property as-is. Adopt the original URI and its definition. If the goal of the terminological adaptations is to rely on the specification as provided for the original URI, apply the guidelines of reuse as-is. Add, if necessary, a note to clarify this. Creating a sub-property that captures the adaptations is recommended as a safe option, however. If the reused property, is itself a specialisation of a third specification, then both shall be explicitly mentioned. In general, we shall show the whole reuse chain (in the conceptual model, and especially in the documentation via notes and hyperlinks). Label Changes to the label are NOT recommended. Some exceptions may be accepted in the case of close synonyms, yet the meaning/semantics MUST stay the same. We strongly recommend differentiating between preferred labels and alternative labels and should be implemented as described below. In UML, * the new label is indicated in the UML Element Name (in CamelCase, no spaces, to provide visibility for the User Community of the Model) * URI of the reused property shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag) * the original label of the reused concept shall be indicated (e.g. in a UML Element Tag + a marker that special name management shall take place) In OWL 2, * original label (as is, either rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel) * new label (as an alternative label, skos:altLabel) In the documentation, * original label (to be visibly mentioned) * new label (in titles and any other fronting) Definition Changes are NOT allowed. Any scoping or nuancing provided in the original data specification should be copied. In addition, new scoping or nuancing shall be provided in the scope notes (e.g., skos:scopeNote ). Domain and range Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Other constraints and additional information Same recommendation as for reusing property, as is Example For example, in DCAT-AP the reused property adms:status is relabeled from \"status\" to \"change type\" for Catalogue Record class. Note that the diagram does not reflect this, but it is reflected in the associated documentation. This scenario applies when the original property is reused with semantic changes, which also implies terminological adaptations. Reuse Aspect Description How to denote the reuse Must create a sub-property that captures the adaptations. In UML, a connector is created denoting a new property, which specialises another connector denoting the original property. Additionally, notes or hyperlinks shall be provided to the original source. Label Provide a new label that is more specific than the one in the reused property Definition Provide a new definition that is more specific than the one of the reused property Domain and range If the reused super property does NOT define domain/range, then it is possible to add domain/range specifications to the sub-property, but only if justified and absolutely necessarily. In UML, feel free to attach it anywhere needed. If the reused super property DOES define a domain/range, DO not override them, i.e. do not specify a new domain/range that leads to logical inconsistencies. Specifically, if you do that, then make sure that the new Domain is a subclass of the Original Domain. If the property is used across multiple classes multiple domain/range specifications can be deemed appropriate. This shall be handled with care. Multiple domain/range definitions in OWL 2 mean intersection (i.e. joined by logical AND) and not the union (i.e. joined by logical OR), as most use cases may require. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the inclusion of domain/range statements is dependent on the \"reuse\" intention of the data specification. In case of a broad reuse intention, as for the SEMIC Core Vocabularies, it is not recommended to include them in the lightweight ontology but optionally reflect them as permissive constraints in SHACL. In case of narrow reuse intention, as for the Application Profiles, it is recommended to provide domain/range specifications in the data shape definitions even if those are optional. Other constraints and additional information Feel free to provide any additional information that is deemed necessary. When the UML is transformed into other representations, the lightweight ontology may be augmented with descriptive information, while (logical) constraints are to be expressed as SHACL. Example For example, in the DCAT-AP the reused property dct:hasPart is specialised as dcat:dataset. Note that the subproperty relation between the two is not depicted in the diagram, but is stated in the data shape specification. Title: Follow a methodology Identifier MC-R1 Statement: It is strongly recommended that a clear, explicit methodology is adopted for the content development and lifecycle management of a semantic data specification. Conversely, no data specification shall be developed and managed without following a clear methodology. Description: A methodology is a set of methods, processes, and practices that are repeatedly carried out to deliver projects (TOGAF [togaf]). It helps by using a clear set of processes for managing projects that everyone in the organisation understands, reducing risks, and improving the chances of success. A good methodology that fits the context and environment of an organisation can provide clear guidance on what, who, when, and how a project should be done. It also provides a clear path and a systematic strategy to solve the in-field problems. We do not outline a concrete methodology here but merely point to the benefits of adopting and using one. In the SEMIC context, conceptual model development will benefit greatly from embracing some or a combination of techniques and frameworks in data modelling (e.g. Bottom-Up, Top-Down, Case-Based, Entity-Relationship, Object-Oriented, Star/Snowflake Schema data modelling techniques, etc.), ontology engineering methodologies (e.g. Methontology [fernandez-lopez97], DOGMA [jarrar08], OntoClean [guarino04], TOVE [fox92], DILIGENT [pinto04], NeOn [neon], etc. [sure09]), data management body of knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK [dama-dmbok]) or architecture frameworks and practices (e.g. TOGAF [togaf], Zachman Framework [zachman87], EAP [spewak06], etc.). Among other benefits of adopting a clear and well-defined methodology are: Clear lifecycle management Connection between model and expressed (business) requirements Implementation consistency Proper business requirements management (specifications, use cases, scenarios, competency questions, etc. are collected, edited, maintained, referred by the concepts) Title: Scope and goals definition Identifier MC-R2 Statement: A semantic data specification shall have clear goals and a well-established scope definition. Description: Establishing project scope ensures that the modelling work is focused and executed to expectations. It also helps define where the boundary of the model is and what shall be left out. The clearer the scope the higher chances of success are. It shall be possible to determine the scope of a data specification from the use cases for which it is drawn up. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.4] Title: Modularisation Identifier MC-R3 Statement: If a domain contains a lot of concepts that have to be modelled, then it is recommended to partition it into subdomains and manage them as connected modules. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] Description: Divide and conquer method works in many situations, including in the modelling realm. It may not be easy, however, to make a clearcut separation between concepts belonging to one module or another, and such an attempt will certainly bring clarity. Sometimes, a concept can be used for several domains. Then it shall be placed in a separate module. [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.3] The need for modularisation typically emerges when the to-be-modelled space grows. As the terms are to be identified by URIs [PC-R2], it is recommended to include in the used URI structure modularisation potential. Examples: For example, in the eProcurement ontology(ePO) [epo], there is a core ontology and there are extension modules such as eCatalogue, eOrdering, and eNotice [epo] that further refine and extend a specific part of the core. For example, Core Location is used across other Core Vocabularies and is established as a CV on its own. Title: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible Identifier GC-R1 Statement: Reuse existing concepts as much as possible, respecting the original semantics and lexicalisation. Description: Only use constructs with semantics (human and machine-readable) that support the use case or domain. A similar reflex must be considered by reusing properties and classes from other vocabularies. As a general rule, it is safe to reuse annotation properties, as they carry no logical semantics. Conversely, no concepts shall be redefined unless they are significant variations of the existent ones. In order to achieve a common approach to reuse, apply the reuse guidelines as specified above [Clarification on the reuse]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Prefer maintained vocabularies Identifier GC-R2 Statement: Quality of maintenance and governance should be reviewed before reuse. Reuse mostly vocabularies that are well maintained and governed. Description: Some projects are implemented and closed, while some other ones keep being maintained. The maintenance usually aims at (a) fixing errors, (b) making gradual improvements, and (c) supporting users in using the released data specification, to mention the least. Maintenance of the project can also include URI dereferencing and handling open issues in a timely fashion. Some projects may foresee an evolution roadmap, defined in a change and release policy, with a series of evolution stages planned. Title: Concept reference and terms Identifier GC-R3 Statement: Each concept shall be (a) referenceable by a URI, (b) formally defined and (c) described by a precise, unambiguous human-readable label and definition. Description: Terms and concepts are not the same things. A term is a word, compound word, or multi-word expression that, in specific contexts, is given specific meanings – these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well-named (termed) by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. So, we need a precise way to refer to concepts. The mechanism offering such a possibility is using URIs to establish the identity of a concept’s \"meaning\". URIs also enable referencing, an essential feature of meaning exchange (communication). Such a reference allows for establishing a common meaning, not only between humans and machines but also among humans. Finally, the meaning of the term must be clear. Its definition is associated with the term via the URI. To make the term reusable, it should be published as part of a data specification. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, epo-arch, oslo-rules ] Title: Vocabulary terminology style Identifier GC-R4 Statement: The terminology style shall be consistent across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, some variation in terminology style (concept naming conventions) can be noticed across a wide range of semantic data specifications. Whatever the adopted style may be, the author shall consistently apply it to the whole model. These names will be reflected in all artefacts and in the URIs. Next, we provide a set of loose recommendations: British English is the lingua franca in the model. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations in concept names Classes are names with nouns and singular Names are case-sensitive. Relations and Properties use verbs at a present tense Some practices suggest adding the prefix \"has\" for quality attributes like \"weight\", \"height\", etc. or the prefix or \"is\" for boolean indicators, and some other practices recommend avoiding such prefixes as they add no additional information to the name. Most often, the name of the inverse relation should not be a semantically inverted verb, such as in the case of \"buys/sells\" or \"opens/closes\". It should be done by changing the voice from active to passive, e.g. \"plays/playedBy\". Title: Vocabulary definition styling Identifier GC-R5 Statement: The concept definitions shall be elaborated consistently across the vocabulary. Description: In practice, different styles of defining concepts can be noticed across a range of semantic data specifications. The SEMIC Principles for creating good definitions [semic-defs] are a basis for writing definitions. They are based on advice found in the literature and are the following: Be concise but complete, Avoid over-generalisations. Adapt and contextualise the definition to the surrounding/connected concepts. Make sure that every concept that occurs in the model is directly (or indirectly) defined Describe only one term Structure the definition in a standardised way: Use the singular form to phrase the definition [GC-R4] State what the term is, and don’t enumerate what it is NOT (no negative definition) Use only commonly understood abbreviations Use similar terminology for related definitions Don’t use circular definitions, i.e. the term defined should not be part of the definition, Don’t add secondary information such as additional explanation, scoping, examples, etc. these are to be documented in usage notes. Form the definition in one or more sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a period. Do not start a definition with a repetition of the name of the concept. Rich standard encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 are supported in notes and definitions. In the element names, however, we recommend avoiding any character encodings and using plain ASCII [epo-cmc, sec 4.2]. Title: Reuse compliance Identifier GC-R6 Statement: Compliance with a semantic data specification is satisfied by appropriate usage of terms that is in accordance with definitions and constraints. Compliance checking with an application semantic data specification shall be permissive. This means that what is not forbidden is permitted. If the context requires more restrictions,then an application profile needs to be established for a narrow(er) scenario. Technically, we envisage compliance checking limited to correct referencing of the concept URIs and respecting the cardinality constraints and value constraints in the case of properties. This falls within the scope of data shape definitions. Additionally, more specific compliance requirements and constraints can be added as necessary. Compliance checking may involve multiple levels of severity. For example in the SHACL specifications three levels are defined: Violation, Warning, Info. We assume by default the SHACL severity specifications unless other denotations systems are provided (i.e. different labels and delimitation of severity). Also in absense of specifications, any unfulfilled compliance check is considered a Violation. The semantic data specifications may provide such severity levels. How it is realised in the conceptual model is open at the moment. The main place to provide such specifications is the data shape artefact. In the future we can return to this aspect and provide more guidance. Title: Deontic modals Identifier GC-R7 Statement: Indicators of deontic modalities for classes and properties do not have semantic or normative value. Still they may be used as editorial annotations. Deontic modalities indicate levels obligation, permission, necessity and related concepts. As a general recommendation, to use deontic indicators in the semantic data specifications is discouraged. Such indicators could be of editorial or guiding role for the users and adopters of the data specifications. However, it should be noted that they are not considered as part of any compliance validation or semantic interpretation of the data model. In the standardisation community a common practice is to indicate levels of obligation or permission for concepts in a semantic data specification. Obligation indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is required in an instantiation; while, Permission indicator signals whether a statement using a class or a property is allowed or forbidden in an instantiation. The common deontic indicator values are: mandatory signifying that a statement using a class or property is required, recommended signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional but recommended, optional signifying that a statement using a class or property is optional, forbidden signifying that a statement using a class or property is not permitted. Still, there are ways to achieve the same effect as the these indicators through other means. For properties, the main instrument is employment of cardinality constraints (per property per class). To make a property mandatory set the minimum cardinality to one or more [1..*], otherwise relax the minimum cardinality constraint to keep the property optional [0..*]. For classes, it is possible to mark a class as abstract, which means that it cannot be directly instantiated, therefore achieving the effect of forbidden. However, deontic indicators shall be avoided for classes because a class may be mandatory and optional in different instantiation or exchange scenarios within the same application profile. For example consider the DCAT-AP and two mandatory classes: dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset. When metadata of a catalogue (and its records) is exchanged, then both classes dcat:Catalog and dcat:Dataset must be instantiated; however when a single dataset metadata is being exchange then only dcat:Dataset instance shall be provided. Moreover, in the second scenario, providing an instance of dcat:Catalog will be counterproductive and possible leading to errors. Descriptions of what classes can or shall be bundled together when participating in information exchange belong in \"data exchange contracts\", \"API endpoint scheme definitions\" or the likes of these. Such specifications belong in the Technical Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif], and are (currently) out of scope of this style guide, which aims primarily at addressing the semantic interoperability. If semantic engineers prefer or are compelled to employ deontic indicators, then deontic indicators must be precisely defined and those definitions must be published. No reliance on common sense understanding shall be assumed as the meaning of such deontic indicators may (and certainly) differ not only among readers of data specifications but also in different data specifications. Title: Conceptual model as single source of truth Identifier CMC-R1 Statement The UML conceptual model should be used as single source of truth. Description By applying this principle, we can achieve consistency among all derived artefacts. This implies: Standard representation of the UML, such as XMI Existence of a well-defined set of rules and conventions to transform UML model into other artefacts, which can be executed, as much as possible automatically, by a dedicated software tool or toolchain [CMC-R2] It is recommended that recent versions of the UML (v2.5+) and XMI (v2.5+) specifications are used [epo-cmc, sec 4.1]. Title: Fixed UML interpretation Identifier CMC-R2 Statement: The UML conceptual model must have a fixed interpretation. Description: Using UML as a graphical language to encode a data specification according to the reuse guidelines requires defining a set of pre-established conventions on the UML notation to reach a fixed interpretation. The interpretation of UML as a logical structure, including OWL 2, was and still is an active research topic. But even the OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel [omg-onto] does not address the notion of reuse. The goal of using UML is to provide for the SEMIC semantic data specifications a standard graphical notation, which many are familiar with. Therefore, the graphical notation should facilitate the understanding of the data specification. The UML notation should match the semantics that are to be expressed in the data specification (the ontology, data shapes and human-readable documentation). The UML is the single source of truth [CMC-R1]. Using the conventions and associated interpretation expressed in this rule, other artefacts are derived from the UML. The benefit of defining such a precise set of mapping rules is that it allows for: Implementing tools to transform UML into derivative artefacts, thus enabling UML as the single source of truth. Implementing tools for formal checking against the established conventions (interpretation), thus enforcing correctness, conformance and consistency. These rules will increase the coherency of the UML diagrams across projects and organisations. Within SEMIC, the interpretation is implemented by the SEMIC toolchain [semic]. The table below provides recommended interpretations of UML elements in OWL 2 and SHACL. These interpretations can be considered high-level mapping rules implementable into transformation tools that generate OWL 2 ontology and, respectively, SHACL constraints from the UML conceptual model.

Property generalisation Sub-property axiom for the generalisation between UML associations and dependencies. Examples: The UML interpretation applied by the SEMIC toolchain is described in [semic-toolchain]. To assist the editor while data modelling to choose the best representation, a test suite is available covering all modelling patterns. The SEMIC toolchain shares the same interpretation as the OSLO toolchain [oslo-toolchain]. In the context of eProcurement ontology, a toolchain has been developed to transform and validate UML models. Such tools are based on two documents: UML convention specifications [epo-cmc] and UML transformation specifications [epo-cm2owl]. Title: Element names and URIs Identifier CMC-R3 Statement: All UML Element names should be fit for URI generation with clear namespace organisation. Description: This convention aims at ensuring that URIs can be generated from UML Element names and shall be treated as an extension to the terminology style conventions [GC-R4]. The Element names are intended as human-readable denominations (called labels) and as machine-readable denominations (called identifiers). This means that the Element names serve as the primary source for generating URIs [puri-bp] to ensure unambiguous machine-readable reference to a formal construct. serve as the primary source for generating labels to ensure human readers' comprehension follow an organisation of namespaces Thus, in the UML model, the Element names must conform to RDF [rdf] and XML [xml] format specifications. Both languages effectively require that terms begin with an upper or lower case letter from the ASCII character set or an underscore (_). This tight restriction means that, for example, terms may not begin with a number, hyphen or accented character [cv-meth]. Although underscores are permitted, they are discouraged as they may be, in some cases, misread as spaces. A formal definition of these restrictions is given in the XML specification document [xml]. Note that, when the UML Element name cannot be used to effectively denominate and identify the concept then, UML Element Tags may be used to express explicitly URIs, labels, notes and other types of annotations [CMC-R6]. Internationalisation, if required, should be provided through the use of the UML Element Tags to specify labels that will be used for generation of specification documents in languages other than English. Country specific data specifications, which are meant to be used primarily at a national level, might decide to relax on this convention and permit the use of Unicode characters in the Element names, which will result in the generations of IRIs, instead of URIs [iri]. However, this is unnecessary, and strongly discouraged, in the SEMIC context. Following this convention is also important in the context of generation of persistent URIs [PC-R2] according to the principles laid out in [10rules-puri]. Examples: The class Address in Core Location has several properties. All the properties have a displayed name (e.g. \"addressArea\") with the UML class diagram and associated UML Tags, such as a label for the HTML specification (\"address area\"), definition, usage note and the related URI. Title: Case sensitivity and charset Identifier CMC-R4 Statement: All UML Element names are case-sensitive and shall follow the CamelCase convention. Description: The names begin with an upper or lower case letter (A–Z, a–z) for all terms in the model. Digits (0–9) are allowed in the subsequent character positions. [epo-cmc, sec 4.2] Moreover, we can significantly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent capitalisation for concept names; therefore, UML Element names shall be CamelCased [epo-cmc, sec 3.2], [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.20]. The names of UML Classes shall start with an upper-case letter, UML Attributes shall start with a lower-case letter, UML Connectors (including Target Roles and Source Roles) shall start with a lower-case letter. The names of UML Enumerations, Packages and Datatypes may start with a lower-case or upper-case letter. Examples: In the image below, there are two classes from Core Location with the related properties and a relation between them. The name of the classes are in UpperCamelCase, the name of the properties are in lowerCamelCase and the relation (adminUnit) is in lowerCamelCase. Title: Namespaces and prefixes in element names Identifier CMC-R5 Statement: Element names shall be organised by namespaces. Namespaces may be indicated through prefixes delimited by colon (:) character, forming qualified names. Description: To enable the reuse of names defined in other models, and the reuse of unique references for names that support easy identification, namespace management must be considered. We adopt the XML and RDF approach to defining and managing namespaces [xml-ns]. A namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organise objects of various kinds so that these objects may be referred to by name and uniquely identifiable [urn]. A qualified name denotes the URI, which is composed of concatenating the expanded prefix with the local segment [turtle]. A qualified name is a name subject to namespace interpretation [xml-ns]. Syntactically, they are either prefixed names or un-prefixed names. A binding declaration shall be maintained, which binds prefixes to namespace URIs and a default namespace applicable to un-prefixed Element names. As the Element name is the primary source for deriving URIs, a base URI and a local segment are necessary. The Element name prefix, before the colon, plays the role of namespace name indicating which base URI shall be used, while the Element name, after the colon, is the local segment. See [xml-ns] for more info. In case the editor decides to omit to specify a prefix in the Element name when a URI generation logic is devised, an implicit prefix can be assumed by default. The qualified names may be structured as follows: prefix:localSegment :localSegment localSegment Note: The prefixes and namespaces shall be well-defined, maintained, and published as part of the data specification. Examples: When dcat a namespace name is declared as bound to base URI http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#, then dcat:Catalog is the qualified name from which the http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Catalog URI is interpreted. When cv (short for Core Vocabularies) namespace name is declared bound to base URI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/, then cv:adminUnit is the qualified name from which the http://data.europa.eu/m8g/adminUnit URI is generated. Title: Rich annotations through tags Identifier CMC-R6 Statement: UML Tags can be conveniently used for annotating the Elements. Description: UML Element tags are key-value pairs that are associated with a UML Element (class, attribute, connector, etc.). The tags can be used as an extension mechanism to the UML language. They can be used to provide information that is not expressible anywhere else on a UML Element. For example, in this style guide, we recommend that the UML Element name shall be used to derive both the concept URI and the concept preferred label. However, if the model editor chooses to use the UML Element name for deriving the concept label alone, then the URI needs to be specified elsewhere. This is one example of how the UML tags can be used: simply specify a new tag, \"uri\", and provide the concept URI as a value (see figure below). Another example where tags came in handy is the provisioning of notes of various types. According to the UML standard, UML Elements have only one general description. We recommend using this description solely for definitions. Yet the scope notes, examples, alternative labels, and any other annotations can be provisioned through the UML tagging mechanism (see figure below). Examples: Title: Explicit depiction of external dependencies Identifier CMC-R7 Statement: The UML diagrams should depict how the developed model relates to external (reused) models. Description: UML does not support an import mechanism comparable to the one specified in OWL 2. Yet, the reuse of models is a highly encouraged practice. To accommodate such practice, the reused Elements shall be created as in the original model and depicted in diagrams. The external Elements shall be clearly marked. The easiest way to do so is by providing a namespace prefix. The original meaning shall be preserved without changes to the labels, concept definitions or URIs. Reused classes shall be depicted in the UML diagrams. Reused properties shall be depicted in diagrams as connectors and attributes. It is not necessary to depict unused classes or properties [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.7]. Examples: In the example below, a Core Vocabulary Person includes concepts from another vocabulary (FOAF); thus the two classes Person and Agent have the \"foaf\" namespace prefix specified in front. Please note that this is an example of reuse with semantic adaptation. In CPV the Person is more restricted than that in FOAF. The foaf:Person class represents people. Something is a foaf:Person if it is a person, and it does not matter whether they are alive, dead, real or imaginary. The foaf:Person class is a subclass of the foaf:Agent class, since all people are considered 'agents' in FOAF. In contrast to that, cpv:Person is defined differently: A individual human being who may be dead or alive, but not imaginary. Hence, the subclass relation. Title: Class inheritance Identifier CMC-R8 Statement: Ensure that the attributes and associations of a superclass apply to all its subclasses. Description: This is a general modelling principle that should be respected, yet when it comes to reusing, such a requirement is often overlooked. This means that the model editor shall carefully analyse the reused model as a whole and how it is integrated with their own model. Examples: In Core Business Vocabulary, the class LegalEntity is a subclass of org:FormalOrganization from the Organization Ontology (which is a subclass of org:Organization, which is a subclass of foaf:Agent), and different properties/relations have been inherited such as hasSubOrganization, hasMember, name, type. See more [oslo-rules sec 3.2.3] Title: Abstract classes Identifier CMC-R9 Statement: Classes that are not intended to be instantiated directly can be marked as abstract. Description: When a (super-)class is created for capturing a level of abstraction in the domain knowledge, it may not always be suitable for instantiation. Editors may choose to mark such classes as abstract and to indicate that their subclasses shall be used in practice. In UML, this can be done via > stereotype [see CMC-R17: Using stereotypes]. Doing so has no impact on the OWL 2 [owl2] representation of the model (as this cannot be expressed in OWL). However, depending on the toolchain implementation, SHACL data shapes [shacl] can be generated to express that no instances of this class shall not occur in the data. See [oslo-rules sec 3.2.6, epo-cmc, sec 4.4] Examples: Both OSLO [oslo-toolchain] and ePO [epo] toolchains support such stereotypes. Title: Attribute definition and usage Identifier CMC-R10 Statement: UML Attributes shall be used to define properties taking simple datatype values. An attribute declaration should specify its datatype and multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: We recommend atomic types are used as attribute types and avoid using another class as the attribute type. Instead, those should be expressed as relationships (represented by Association connectors) between the two classes [CMC-R12]. The reason for this is to keep a clear separation between (a) properties that take a literal value (governed by a datatype, and conceptually corresponding to owl:DatatypeProperty) and (b) properties that take a reference value (governed by a class, corresponding to owl:ObjectProperty). Doing so has two advantages: (a) it confers homogeneity to the model, which enhances readability and decreases ambiguity; (b) the toolchain implementation is easier as there is a clear treatment and interpretation. literal properties (expressed as attributes datatypes) and relations between two classes (expressed as association connectors). The advantage of In case of primitive datatypes, high preference shall be given to using OWL 2 compliant XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf] standard datatypes. For more detailed recommendations on the use of primitive datatypes see convention [CMC-R18]. Properties whose values come from a controlled vocabulary or authority table constitute a special case, because two modelling practices are recognised here: (a) as attributes with type \"Code\", and (b) as dependency relations pointing to a UML Enumeration named after the controlled list. In the first case, the attribute type \"Code\" shall be mapped to the skos:Concept class. The advantage of this approach is the compactness of the diagrams, as fewer boxes appear in them. The disadvantage is the omission to specify precisely, which list the property values are restricted to. Arguably, the controlled list can be provided via the additional UML Tags [CMC-R6], but that value will not be visible in the diagrams. In the second case, the property is modelled not as an attribute but by using a UML Dependency connector between the UML Class, and the UML Enumeration representing the controlled list, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It denotes that the OWL 2 class has an owl:ObjectProperty whose range is of type skos:Concept and is limited to values of the specified controlled vocabulary. The connector must have a \"Source→Target\" direction. No other directions are acceptable, and a valid target role name and multiplicity shall be provided [CMC-R14]. Finally, we emphasise that UML Connectors are reserved for the object properties only. Hence, none shall be established between a UML Class element and a UML Datatype element. Examples: Here we provide an example for the two approaches of specifying attribute datatypes described above. In the CCCEV specification, the class attributes of the Requirement and Evidence classes use loose UML and other datatypes: String, Literal, and Code. No precise definition of what they mean is provided. The attributes are left underspecified, and with generic datatypes: the description attribute is a generic String, while the type and confidentialityLevelType attributes are specified as Code (without explicitly indicating what this datatype means). It is also not clear what would be the difference between Literal and String, although one might gain an intuition from the attribute names. The same classes are reused in the ePO ontology, where the cccev:Requirement and cccev:Evidence class attributes explicitly specify standard datatypes and cardinalities. Additionally, the cccev:confidentialityLevelType attribute, and also the cccev:type attribute, although not depicted in the screenshot, indicated in the original specification, were converted to dependency connectors, because they are not using an atomic datatype, but rather a controlled list of skos:Concept(s) coming from controlled vocabularies, such as at-voc:confidentiality-level. Title: Multiplicity of attributes and connectors Identifier CMC-R11 Statement: The multiplicity of connectors and class attributes should be specified, indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. The cardinality shall be as permissive as possible in Core Vocabularies and as restrictive as necessary in Application Profiles. Description: If the UML model is developed to represent a Core Vocabulary, then the property cardinality (both UML Attributes and UML Association) shall be as permissive as possible, for example, [0..*], meaning any occurrence is allowed. If a structural feature (attribute or association) is irrelevant for the domain or the applications, instead of setting a lower limit of multiplicity to 0, simply remove it from the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. However, in the UML models representing Application Profiles, special attention shall be given to the multiplicity, reducing variation in the instance data to a minimum. And if a property (attribute or connector) is mandatory in the data, then its minimum cardinality shall be set to 1, for example [1..*] [epo-cmc, sec 4.5]. A good practice is to always indicate cardinality. It may be left unspecified, but this is not recommended. When in doubt, it is recommended to fall back on the implicit assumption of [0..*]. Not to be confused with the default cardinality assumed in tools. For example, Enterprise Architect by default assumes [1..1] cardinality for attributes and omits to display it; and a similar default assumption exists in XML/XSD. Notation for multiple cardinality can be either with * or n. In principle using either notation is fine, however, it is recommended to use only one of those notations within a given data specification consistently, if possible, to enhance readability. It is worth highlighting this, as some UML tools, by default, might use a different notation for multiple cardinality depending on whether it is specifying the cardinality of attributes vs. that of connectors. The UML processing tools should be implemented so as to handle either of those notations, as their meaning is identical. Unless, well explained, no rigid constraints shall be imposed on attributes and associations. In other words, if specified, the cardinality shall be the most permissive, where possible [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Limit the constraints to business rules, do not add technical constraints to the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.16]. If an attribute or an association from a reused vocabulary is irrelevant, do not set the lower limit of multiplicity to 0, but simply omit it in the model [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.15]. Examples: All Core Vocabularies have set a permissive cardinality [0..*], for example, all the properties of Public Organisation, shown with ligh orange background, have multiplicity [0..*], while the same Public Organisation reused in CPSV-AP, shown in blue, has mandatory properties: Title: Connector definition and usage Identifier CMC-R12 Statement: UML Connectors shall be used to define relations and properties taking non-atomic type values. A connector declaration should specify multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Description: UML Connectors shall be used to denote object properties (see OWL 2 semantics, [owl2]). First, we explain how the connectors ought to be used, i.e., where to specify the relationship names and multiplicity. Then we explain the optional usage of the dependency connector type. On connector names, a generic UML connector may have a name applied to it, and it may have source/target roles specified in addition. This provides flexibility to how the domain knowledge may be expressed in UML; however, this freedom increases the level of ambiguity as well. Therefore, we foresee two distinct ways to express properties: using the connector (generic) name or using the connector source/target ends. We strongly recommend using the source/target role name to indicate the relation name and leave empty the (generic) element name. So, if a target role is specified, then no connector name can be specified. Optionally a source role may be provided to indicate the inverse relation. In this case, the relation direction must be changed from \"Source → Target\" to \"Bidirectional\". Or conversely, if the connector direction is \"Bidirectional\", then source and target roles must be provided. No other directions are permitted. It is recommended that each association has a definition. The definition is then used for each role as they represent the same meaning manifested in the inverse direction. Alternatively, definitions can be specified along the target and source roles. UML defines multiple types of connectors. We recommend relying mainly on the UML Association connector type. Optionally a UML Dependency Connector type may be used if the meaning and usage conditions are well-defined. The UML Association connectors represent relations between a source and a target classes. The association connector cannot be used between other kinds of UML Elements. The UML Dependency connector may be used between a UML Class and UML Enumeration boxes, oriented from the Class towards the Enumeration. It indicates the class has an owl:ObjectProperty, whose range is a controlled vocabulary [CMC-R14]. The connector must have the direction \"Source → Target\". No other directions are acceptable. The UML Generalization connector signifies a class-subClass relation and is transformed into rdfs:subClassOf relation standing between a source and target classes. The connector must have no name or source/target roles specified in the UML model. If a model class should inherit a class from an external model, then proxies must be created for those classes [GC-R1, Reuse of a class with semantic adaptation]. For example, if Person specialises a foaf:Agent. Title: All elements are \"public\" Identifier CMC-R13 Statement: The visibility of all UML Elements should be \"public\". Description: For semantic data specifications, accessibility to the information is not a concern. The sole concern is to specify the semantics of the information as precisely as possible. Therefore, the UML access or privacy annotations shall not be interpreted, and the \"+\" symbol shall always be used next to each property. This symbol means \"public\" [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.22]. Examples: The Person class in Core Vocabulary Person only has public properties indicated with a \"+\" symbol next to each property. Title: Controlled lists as Enumerations Identifier CMC-R14 Statement: The controlled lists of values shall be referred to as UML Enumerations and specified whenever possible. Description: References to controlled lists shall be done via UML Enumeration elements. Content and lifecycle management of controlled lists shall be separated from the management of the semantic data specification. Controlled lists play an essential role in establishing interoperability standards. Management and publication of controlled lists are not part of this style guide. The expectation is that the controlled lists are published in accordance with best practices and represented with the SKOS model using persistent identifiers. In such an approach, the controlled list is expressed as a skos:ConceptScheme and the specific values as skos:Concept(s). Also, such controlled lists are often developed, published and maintained independently following their own lifecycle, so that they can be reused in other models. Two use-cases can be identified in practice: (a) when the code list is known and is explicitly referred to as the range of a property, and (b) when a property is modelled but no code list reference is provided as its range. When the authors of a conceptual model intend to omit which controlled list shall be used, then a class attribute with the range skos:Concept (in some cases Code is preferred) can be created to indicate that. This approach can be useful in situations when multiple (external) controlled lists can be used interchangeably. For example, the adms:status property of a dcat:CatalogueRecord shall be a skos:Concept, without specifying the controlled list. It is advisable, however, to be specific concerning which controlled list shall be used. In such cases, an Enumeration shall be created representing the controlled list. The Enumeration shall be empty, i.e., not specifying any value, because the values are assumed to be maintained externally and only the reference is necessary. The properties having this controlled list as range shall be depicted as UML connectors (dependencies or associations) between a Class and an Enumeration [CMC-R2]. For example, in ePO, dct:Location can have a country code represented as a dependency relation to at-voc:country (the country authority table published on the EU Vocabularies website). The name of the Enumeration shall be resolved to a URI identical to that of the skos:ConceptScheme. As for the connector type we recommend using a dependency connector (depicted with a dashed line) because the semantic interpretation differs slightly from the association connector (depicted with a continuous line). Namely, the range of the property has to fulfil two constraints: (a) instantiating the skos:Concept class and (b) being skos:inScheme the intended controlled list [epo-arch]. If the controlled list is specific to the model then the author shall define the values of the UML Enumeration inside of it, which are interpreted as concepts belonging to the containing concept scheme [oslo-rules, sec 3.2.17]. Examples: The COFOG controlled list is suggested in Core Public Organisation to describe the purpose of an Organisation (as depicted in the image on top) while in CPSV-AP, the same COFOG list is used to indicate the functions of government which a public service is intended for (as depicted in the image below). While the COFOG controlled list is owned by the UN and maintained by the Publications Office in the form of SKOS concept schemes, it can be reused by the Core Public Organisation and CPSV-AP independently. Title: Partition the model into packages Identifier CMC-R15 Statement: Packages have no semantic value, but shall be used whenever possible to logically organise the model. Description: It is highly recommended to avoid defining any semantic interpretation into UML Packages, as they are best used for organisational purposes, defining logical partitions in the model. Therefore, packages can serve as a method of slicing the conceptual model into subdomains. It is also possible to use packages as namespace indicators. Although it works well for classes, it fails to cover the needs for managing namespaces of connectors and attributes. Moreover, it does not work in cases when an attribute, or a connector is used multiple times in several packages. Hence, namespace management is easier attained by using other methods such as using prefixes in Element names or using Element tags [epo-cmc, sec 4.3]. Examples: In the image below, each class is organised in a package mapped to a namespace. However, for convenience, Core Vocabularies are in multiple packages but mapped to the same namespace. Title: Diagram readability Identifier CMC-R16 Statement: UML class diagrams shall be organised for readability. Description: UML class diagrams are used for depicting the conceptual model. Their primary purpose is to construe the meaning of concepts, relations and their organisation to the human reader. Therefore, the diagrams shall be optimised for readability. We recommend that the diagrams: are well spaced (proper space between lines, boxes and labels) minimise the number of crossing connectors prefer orthogonal to straight connectors align elements horizontally & vertically space elements evenly avoid overlapping labels and depict all labels align labels horizontally and avoid vertical or oblique alignment place subclasses under or to the right of their parent place the part under or to the right of the whole at aggregates or composites . minimise the number of details are short and concise (multiple small(-er) diagrams are preferred to one large diagram) diagram size: prefer multiple themed small(er) diagrams to large and crowded ones diagrams shall not be bigger than one A4 page simplify complex diagrams: by breaking it down into several smaller diagrams by highlighting certain parts of the diagram by hiding attributes, role names, etc. that are not relevant symbol size: symbols should be equal nothing shall draw more attention unless intended elements of equal importance should be equally large inherited attributes of a superclass shall be visible if the superclass is not in the diagram See also [ oslo-rules, semic-sgdraft ] Examples: In the example below, taken from Core Person, the classes are aligned vertically and horizontally, subclasses are placed just below the related parent class, the relations are horizontal, vertical, or orthogonal. Title: Element stereotypes Identifier CMC-R17 Statement: Stereotypes do not have semantic or normative value. They shall be avoided in the conceptual models unless a good motivation, and a strong need is provided. Description: We strongly encourage semantic practitioners to avoid stereotypes of any normative or semantic value. One common usage of stereotypes is to provide deontic indicators. See [GC-7 on Deontic modals] where we explain why their use is discouraged and what can be done instead. There is a practice to mark some classes as \"abstract\" with the intention of preventing those from being instantiated. This is also a technical level constraint and does not belong in the semantic layer. We acknowledge that stereotypes can be useful for editorial and dissemination purposes; to indicate a classification or grouping of a specific sort. Stereotypes can be used to support concerns specific to an implementation of the transformation toolchain. See the examples below. Examples: Stereotypes can be used to indicate what content goes into various output file during the transformation process. Stereotypes can be used to visually group the class attributes. When applied on the relations (UMl connectors) stereotypes have the opposite effect: that of cluttering and decrease the diagram readability. Title: Datatype definition and usage Identifier CMC-R18 Statement: We strongly recommend that only OWL 2 compliant datatypes are used. The creation of custom datatypes shall be avoided. Description: Similar to [epo-cmc, sec 4.7], this convention draws the distinction between primitive (or atomic) types (consisting of single literal value) and composite types (consisting of multiple attributes) (see also [cv-handbook, sec 3.1]). In fact, the composite datatypes must be defined as classes and handled as such. For example, Amount, Identifier, Quantity and Measurement are to be treated as classes, even if conceptually they could be seen as composite datatypes. It is recommended to employ the primitive datatypes that are already defined in XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf], in particular a subset of those that is OWL 2 compliant. This should cover the standard, and most common types. Thus, definitions of custom datatypes shall be avoided unless the model really needs them. Such cases are, however, rare. The reason for avoiding complex datatypes, is that once we start structuring how data shall be organised, besides syntactic definitions, we inevitably embed semantic aspects as well. Doing so, the semantics of the structure is obscured and trapped in a technical interoperability layer. For example, xsd:duration encodes both the amount(s) and unit(s) of time into a regular expression that looks like this P5Y2M10D. The definition of datatypes in the UML model should be also avoided, even in cases where a toolchain performing the transformation of UML can automatically resolve those into their XSD equivalent using a correspondence table, such as the one presented below. Note that from the family of string datatypes we recommend using the following ones (in this order of preference): rdf:PlainLiteral, rdfs:Literal, xsd:string, and rdf:langString. Often enabling multilingual data specification is a necessity. UML XSD Boolean xsd:boolean Float xsd:float Integer xsd:integer Character, String xsd:string / rdf:langString Short xsd:short Long xsd:long Decimal xsd:decimal Date xsd:date DateTime xsd:dateTime xsd:anyURI Code see CMC-R14 We strongly recommended the use of OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF standard datatypes, if possible. They might be useful also for indicating a specific datatype, which is not possible with the UML ones. For example, making a distinction between a general string (xsd:string) and a literal with a language tag (rdf:langString), or XML encoded ones such as rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral. The table above provides a simplified correspondence between UML and XSD datatypes, but for a complete list of available recommended datatypes the standard specifications shall be consulted: RDF working group XSD Datatype maps RDF 1.1 Datatypes section OWL 2 Datatype Maps Title: Formal language choice Identifier SC-R1 Statement: The formal ontology shall be expressed in OWL 2. Description: In the Semantic Web domain, two formal languages can be used for expressing the ontology: RDFS [rdfs] and OWL 2 [owl2]. RDFS is simpler and only allows for some of the recommended expressions (for example, the distinction between datatype and object properties is not possible). OWL 2 is more complex and more expressive than RDFS. We recommend using only a limited set of expression types available in OWL 2 language [SC-R2]. Examples: Core Vocabularies have an RDF representation as OWL 2 Ontology. In the example below, part of Core Person is depicted: @prefix dc: . @prefix foaf: . @prefix owl: . @prefix rdf: . @prefix rdfs: . @prefix schemas: . @prefix xsd: . a rdfs:Class; rdfs:label \"Person\"@en . a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; dc:mediator [ foaf:homepage ; foaf:name \"Semantic Interoperability Community (SEMIC)\" ]. Title: Limited (OWL 2) expressivity Identifier SC-R2 Statement: The formal ontology shall be lightweight in its logical underpinning, focusing mainly on the concept declarations, generalisation axioms and annotations. Description: OWL 2 language provides a high level of expressivity. In the SEMIC interoperability context, the primary purpose of semantic artefacts is to establish the common set of concepts and how they are employed in data exchange. For this purpose, simple OWL 2 constructs suffice. Therefore, the OWL 2 ontology shall be kept lightweight, and no advanced logical definitions are necessary, which would make the ontology heavyweight. The Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, dedicated an entire section on the charm of weak semantics in the linked data world. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. We recommend the formal ontology definition be limited to the following types of expressions: class declarations (owl:Class, rdfs:Class) data property declarations (owl:DatatypeProperty, rdf:Property) object property declarations (owl:ObjectProperty, rdf:Property) subclass relations (rdfs:subClassOf) subproperty relations (rdfs:subPropertyOf) annotations concept labels (rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel, skos:altLabel) concept definitions (rdfs:comment, skos:definition, skos:scopeNote) notes and comments (rdfs:comment, skos:editorialNote, skos:changeNote, skos:historyNote, skos:example) ontology header with import statements (owl:import) version metadata (owl:versionInfo, owl:versionIRI) provenance metadata (e.g. dct:issued, adms:status) descriptive metadata The formal ontology shall not include other types of statements unless justified as necessary. The properties used, in particular those related to the ontology header, shall be aligned with the governance process. No expressions of (a) property domain specification (rdfs:domain) and (b) property range specification (rdfs:range) shall be used unless justified as absolutely necessary. The need for setting property domain and range constraints is better fulfilled by the data shapes expressed in SHACL language. Keeping the ontology lightweight allows the maximum freedom for reuse (e.g. in different application profiles, where domains/ranges can be specified or restricted), and does not interfere with the validation concerns covered by the data shapes. Note: This recommendation does not prevent the generation of more heavyweight ontologies (i.e. with higher level of logical expressivity), as additional artefacts that would be included in the data specification. A data specification could even provide several such ontology versions, one for each OWL 2 profiles (EL/QL/RL), for example, if there are well-defined use cases identified for them. However, if such additional ontologies will be provided as part of the data specification, it is essential that they are all be kept consistent with all the other artefacts (including the lightweight ontology, the human-readable version, etc.) (see section on Transformation). Therefore, it is highly recommended having appropriate tool support, which enables the automatic generation of all the ontologies that are needed from the conceptual model. Regardless of how many ontology versions will be generated and published as part of the data specification, the most important thing, and hence the main point of this recommendation, is that there should always be at least one lightweight ontology, to support a highest level of interoperability and reuse. Often, this is called the \"core\" ontology, in data specifications that provide multiple ontology versions, while the other, more expressive, ontology versions have different names. Examples: For example, consider the (shortened) DCAT-AP imports header: rdf:type owl:Ontology ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports ; owl:imports . Or consider, the (shortened) Core Person vocabulary header: a owl:Ontology; rdfs:label \"core-person-voc\"@en, \"core-person-voc\"@nl; dc:contributor [ a foaf:Person; foaf:firstName \"Seth\"; foaf:lastName \"van Hooland\"; schemas:affiliation [foaf:name \"European Commission\"] ]; dc:license \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\", ; Title: Lexicalisation Identifier SC-R3 Statement: The choice in handling the lexicalisation of concepts shall be clearly defined and consistently implemented. Description: The lexicalisation of concepts in semantic artefacts can be implemented in multiple ways. Two popular approaches are used in practice: RDFS or SKOS lexicalisation. However, other types can be considered as well (e.g. [lemon], [vann], etc.). RDFS allows for a simple lexicalisation and annotation: labels rdfs:label may be used to provide a human-readable version of a resource’s name. comments rdfs:comment may be used to provide a human-readable description of a resource. SKOS offers a richer and more elaborate lexicalisation and annotation: Lexical labels skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel are useful when generating or creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organisation system. These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS concept. skos:hiddenLabel has a more technical nature and may be useful when a user is interacting with a knowledge organisation system via a text-based search function. The user may, for example, enter misspelled words when trying to find a relevant concept. Documentation properties skos:definition supplies a complete explanation of the intended meaning of a concept; skos:scopeNote supplies some, possibly partial, information about the intended meaning of a concept, especially as an indication of how the use of a concept is limited in indexing practice; skos:note useful for general documentation purposes; skos:example supplies an example of the use of a concept; skos:historyNote describes significant changes to the meaning or the form of a concept; skos:changeNote documents fine-grained changes to a concept, for the purposes of administration and maintenance; skos:editorialNote supplies information that is an aid to administrative housekeeping, such as reminders of editorial work still to be done, or warnings in the event that future editorial changes might be made. We recommend one, or the other is used. Both can be used at the same time without any consequence of semantics, but this will introduce redundancy and possibly a maintenance burden. Examples: For example, in Core Person Vocabulary RDFS lexicalisation is used: a rdf:Property; rdfs:label \"date of birth\"@en . For example in ePO, both lexicalisations are provided (even if this may be considered redundant): :Term a owl:Class ; rdfs:label \"Term\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; rdfs:isDefinedBy ; skos:definition \"A governing condition or stipulation.\"@en ; skos:prefLabel \"Term\"@en . Title: Reasoning assumption Identifier SC-R4 Statement: No reasoning capabilities shall be assumed. Description: OWL 2 constructs correspond to Description Logic (DL) concepts (direct semantics). Logic, besides expressing knowledge in a knowledge base, can be used to perform automated reasoning, i.e., inferring new knowledge based on premises and reasoning rules. The inference is also possible with RDF-based semantics, based on translating the axioms into directed graphs. The latter is used for SPARQL entailments and SHACL data shape rules. Automated reasoning is not consistently available across environments: small differences in the usage context or reasoning patterns may lead to different outcomes. Therefore, the editors of interoperable semantic data specifications are strongly recommended to NOT rely on such capabilities. Thus, in practice, the model shall allow for an explicit statement of the intended knowledge, and as little as possible shall be left implicit. Title: Circular definitions Identifier SC-R5 Statement: The data specification (semantic, conceptual, or shape) shall not use circular definitions. Description: Circular definition, i.e., definitions that use the element they define are incorrect. For instance, we say that an ontology element (a class, an object property or a data property) is circular when used in its own definition. This can occur in situations such as the following: (a) the definition of a class as the enumeration of several classes including itself; (b) the appearance of a class within its owl:equivalentClass or rdfs:subClassOf axioms; (c) the appearance of an object property in its rdfs:domain or rdfs:range definitions; or (d) the appearance of a data property in its rdfs:domain definition. Title: Data shape language choice Identifier DSC-R1 Statement: The data shapes shall be expressed in SHACL. Description: There are various languages allowing for data shape expression and thus define validation rules for RDF data. Among the executable ones, the most well-known are SHACL [shacl] and ShEx [shex]. We are aware that a strong community of practice exists for ShEx. However, as SHACL is a W3C standard, we strongly recommend using it. Title: Loose versus rigid constraints Identifier DSC-R2 Statement: In a Core Vocabulary, then the data shape constraints shall be as loose as possible, i.e., permissive, while in an Application Profile, the data shape constraints shall be as rigid as necessary, i.e. restrictive. Description: The Core Vocabularies are intended for a broad reuse and are concerned with establishing the concepts. This is addressed by the ontology artefact. Optionally it may be accompanied by a minimal set of data shape constraints expressing general domain limitations. For example, it may be already defined in the Core Vocabulary that a class cannot be instantiated without certain mandatory properties or that a declared property shall be used only with values from a pre-established controlled vocabulary. If a data shape artefact is provided, then any Application Profile reusing the Core Vocabulary shall not only import the ontology, but the data shapes as well. The Application Profiles are usually intended for narrower use cases and mostly are concerned with setting restrictions on the way reused vocabulary ought to be used. It is a good practice to make such restrictions as restrictive as necessary but still provide space for variation as it typically occurs in practice. This is even more important when an Application Profile is conceived as reusable in other Application Profiles. Examples: Consider DCAT-AP, for example. It is an Application Profile on top of the DCAT vocabulary, but other more specific Application Profiles are still created on top of it (e.g., DCAT-AP CH, DCAT-AP DE, DCAT-AP NO, etc.) Title: Open and Closed world assumptions Identifier DSC-R3 Statement: The data instantiating a core model may be fragmented across information systems. For representation purposes, open-world assumptions shall be adopted, and for validation purposes, a closed-world assumption shall be adopted. Description: Operations on the data, such as automated reasoning and validation, are impacted by what is assumed about its completeness. If it is considered complete, then we say that we operate under the closed-world assumption; otherwise, in the cases of continually evolving and distributed data (that is more in line with reality), the data is considered possibly incomplete, and we say that operating is under the open-world assumption. Under the closed-world assumption, it is presumed that a true statement is also known to be true. Therefore, conversely, what is not currently known to be true, is false [reiter81]. The opposite of the closed-world assumption is the open-world assumption stating that lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. The truth value of a statement may be true despite whether or not it is known to be true. This means that when validating, the data must be considered complete to assess whether it fulfils the imposed constraints or recommended shapes. Therefore, everything that is not known to be true must be considered false. This may have an impact, especially for larger vocabularies (such as the eProcurement ontology), on how the data shapes are organised. As data shapes may be used to suggest how the data may be fragmented and how it shall not. Title: Shape definitions Identifier DSC-R4 Statement: Each ontology class shall be mirrored by a sh:NodeShape. The property constraints may be embedded (contextualised) within node shapes or defined as freestanding. Description: When generating SHACL shapes, it is a good practice to create a node shape for each class in the Conceptual Model and, within it, a property shape for each property of that class. If the property shapes are defined within the node shapes (rather than freestanding), then we mirror the structure depicted in the Conceptual Model. Doing so is intuitive for the readers, the resulting constraint definitions are organically integrated, and the maintenance costs are decreased. However, sometimes it may be useful to define the property shapes as freestanding, therefore making them reusable independent of the node shape context. Freestanding property shapes are universal constraints on the property. They apply to all usages, in all possible data exchanges. Therefore, their use should be limited to those cases that support the broadest reuse context, and do not encode a specific application usage context. As such, freestanding property shapes play more a role in the validation of the correct usage of the property in an application context, rather than in the correct data exchange. The above considerations do not exclude that property shapes used within a node shape could be named with a unique URI, through the reuse of which a coherent network of constraints can be facilitated. The shapes shall be created in a separate namespace in order to allow dereferencing to either OWL 2 or SHACL definitions. In some communities, the URIs used in the OWL 2 specifications are reused in SHACL. The class definitions are extended as node shapes. In SHACL semantics, this is interpreted as an equivalent to specifying a sh:targetNode class. This approach allows the use of a single reference in both the ontology and data shape definition yet specifies separate concerns in separate artefacts. The advantage of the approach is increased consistency and readability while maintenance costs decrease. Yet, this approach does not allow for dereferencing separately OWL 2 or SHACL representations. Hence, it is recommended to avoid such practice. Title: Data shape severity Identifier DSC-R5 Statement: It is recommended to use constraint severity for distinguishing critical violations from non-critical recommendation warnings and from nice-to-have information. Description: Data shapes can be assigned a level of severity. The specific values of severity have no impact on the validation but may be used by user interface tools to categorise validation results. The severity levels are: Info - A non-critical constraint violation indicating an informative message. Warning - A non-critical constraint violation indicating a warning. Violation - A constraint violation. Title: 5-star Linked Open Data Identifier PC-R1 Statement: Publishing data specifications shall be compliant with 5-star LOD criteria. Description: Publishing a vocabulary as a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource means making it accessible, both human and machine-readable, in a standard way, thus supporting the semantic web. The publication as full LOD implies that the data is compliant with the highest grade of 5-Star [5star-od] open data evaluation: The data is available on the Web under an open licence The data is available following a clear structure The data is available using a non-proprietary open format The data uses URIs to denote concepts The data is linked to other resources to provide context On the same note, the FAIR Data Principles [fair-principles] is a more comprehensive and rich set of guidelines for publishing data on the web. They ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data, as a result of the increase in volume, complexity and creation speed of data [fair-guidelines]. See more [ dwbp, ld-bp, ldp-bp ] Title: Persistent URI policy Identifier PC-R2 Statement: The URIs that are used to identify the terms modelled in the data specifications should be dereferenceable Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] and comply with a URI policy (or URI strategy). URIs that are well-defined according to such criteria are often denoted as PURIs [10rules-puri]. SEMIC adheres to the EU persistent URI policy. Each SEMIC URI is dereferenceable in both machine representation (RDF artefacts) and human-readable (HTML artefact). Description: When publishing data on the web [dwdp], it is crucial to have a structured and persistent system of URIs in place. Such URIs make it easy for the users to understand the vocabulary structure and retrieve information as they expect. The 10 rules for Persistent URIs [10rules-puri] are base principles for the design of quality identifiers. Regarding URI design, the main consideration of creators should be that when a URI is created, all its parts should be resistant to change. For instance, locations and organisation names can change and therefore should not be used in URIs. First and foremost, when introducing semantics in URIs, the strings used need to reflect what the resources are (i.e. intrinsic characteristics such as the type or nature), not who owns them or where they are [uri-dp]. In 2014, the ISA Programme devised a common policy for managing persistent HTTP-based URIs of EU institutions [uri-dp, 10rules-puri, puri-gov-eu]. That has led to an EU wide URI resolution service, prescribing that each URI is of the following pattern: http://data.europa.eu/{Collection}/{Reference} The {Collection} is an organisation-agnostic name for a collection of terms. Within a {Collection} the local names, or references, are being maintained according to the policy of the {Collection}. For SEMIC data specifications, the names are dependent on the naming conventions mentioned in this style guide rules [GC-R4 + CMC-R3]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp, ] Examples: For example, the PURIs defined within the SEMIC Core Vocabularies are all within the {Collection} m8g. And thus the term Evidence in the context of CCCEV is denoted with the PURI http://data.europa.eu/m8g/Evidence. Title: Version management Identifier PC-R3 Statement: A consistent version management shall be implemented for the data specification evolution respecting the \"semantic versioning\" principles. Description: The SEMIC versioning methodology is based on \"semantic versioning\" principles [sem-ver] and implements a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. It involves describing clearly and precisely what is being published and which features are included, and what the limitations are, setting the expectations and scope. Once the artefacts are identified for the public, the changes to the data specifications are communicated with specific increments to the version number and with associated change notes. The version format is X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). As a rule of thumb, bug fixes do not affect the artefact and increment the Patch version. Backwards compatible artefact additions/changes increment the Minor version. And, backwards-incompatible artefact changes increment the Major version. Examples: For example, evolving from version 1.3.5 to 1.3.6 represents a backwards-compatible patch, from 1.3.5 to 1.4.0, a backwards-compatible new development, while switching from 1.3.5 to 2.0.0 breaks the backwards compatibility. Title: Artefact versioning Identifier PC-R4 Statement: The data specification shall be versioned as a whole and never to atomic elements (concepts, relations or constraints). Description: Create a new version with each publication. Using the semantic version principles to determine the exact version number depends on whether it is a major, minor or patch update. The version shall be assigned to the entire vocabulary or Application Profile and never to elements in the model (concepts, relations, constraints, etc.) [oslo-rules, sec 3.1.6]. The version shall be saved as the model metadata (for example, in the owl:Ontology header). No version information shall be embedded into any artefact URIs unless it is a version URI provided via owl:versionIRI. Title: URI dereferencing Identifier PC-R5 Statement: Any URI identifiable resource devised in a data specification shall be dereferenceable. Description: Dereferencing means that one can use the URI as an URL to retrieve related information back. The format and representation in which the information is returned depend on content negotiation. Content negotiation is the interaction between the client application and the server in which the client informs the server about its preferred format and representation and the server responds with the best-fitting result it can provide. It is recommended to provide (format) content negotiation for HTTP which is based on the interpretation of the Accept: HTTP header. The dereferencing shall be provided for both human-readable and machine-readable formats. A human-aimed HTML representation is the default response (if no content type is specified), and the other is RDF [10rules-puri]. Because the HTML representation is usally a long document, which makes it hard to find the information about a specific term, it is recommended that the HTML representation has landing points based on the used fragment identifier. Dereferencing can then route the reader to the most relevant information within the HTML document. For other representations/formats no additional requirements are imposed. For example, the dereferencing in the RDF representation, depends on the implemented recipe, i.e. based on # or /; and it may return either the corresponding fragment or the whole RDF document [pub-recipe]. Further technical details can be found in \"Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies\" [rdf-pub]. See more [ ld-bp, ldp-bp, dwbp ] Title: Human-readable form Identifier PC-R6 Statement: Each data specification shall have a corresponding human-readable form representing the model documentation. Description: The documentation content shall follow a standard template for consistent formatting and content structuring. It is a good practice to provide the following sections in the document: Preamble with metadata indicating Title Abstract Date of publication/release Version information Authors, editors, contributors Licensing information Introduction describing the Background information Context & Scope Intended audience UML diagrams of the model Description of each element in the model grouped by element type (e.g. class, property, constraint, controlled vocabulary). Each element shall be described by its URI and its Lexicalisation: URI (shall be clearly visible) Labels (preferred and alternative) Definitions, scope notes, examples, editorial notes, etc. Moreover, consider following the good practices for documenting OWL 2 and SHACL artefacts, and include the appropriate details in the data specification documentation. For OWL 2, we can mention tools like Widoco [widoco] and LODE [lode]; and for SHACL, follow the SHACL recommendation [shacl], or the metadata support implemented in tools such as SHACL-play [shacl-play]. For application profiles, consider aligning to the DCAP [dcap], which is an implementation agnostic recommendation. Title: Short reference to the rule Identifier The acronym used to reference the rule in this document. Statement: Each rule should be stated in a simple sentence. Description: Optionally, a rule may have a more elaborate description of how to apply, when to apply it, why it is useful, and what is its scope. Or it can be optionally answering questions such as: What is the rationale? Why is the rule useful? What are the benefits of applying this rule? What are the constraints or limitations? What implications does this rule have in practice (e.g. requirements for applying)? When to apply it? How to apply it? To what exceptions to pay attention? The description should be 1-2 paragraphs at most. Examples: Optionally, a rule may have some examples of where it applies and how it is manifested.

There are semantic data specifications. They comprise nothing else but a collection of terms, structure and rule specifications on how to combine these terms and (RE)use expectations. In the SEMIC context, a semantic data specification can be either: a Core Vocabulary, or an Application Profile There are Artefacts. They encode or indicate a representation format, attend a need or specific purpose, and address a clear concern. In the SEMIC context, we acknowledge, but not limited to, the following list of artefacts: Persistent URIs OWL 2 representation SHACL representation HTML representation Pictures/Diagrams UML representation JSON-LD representation (+ JSON schema) XML representation (+ XSD schema) …​ Note that not all artefacts are treated in the current style-guide, but only the ones that are in scope of the Semantic Interoperability layer of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [eif]. Definition A conceptual model, also referred to as conceptual model specification, is an abstract representation of a system and comprises well-defined concepts, their qualities or attributes, and their relationships to other concepts. A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. Description A conceptual model is a representation of a system that uses concepts to form said representation. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [skos]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well named by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. The conceptual model comprises representations of concepts, their qualities or attributes and relationships to other concepts. Most commonly, these are association and generalisation relations. In addition, the conceptual model can be materialised in a graphical representation facilitating knowledge elicitation, organisation and interaction with domain experts. This is relevant because interactions and discussions within a Working Group for a data specification are often driven by a graphical representation. However, the need for a conceptual model and a visual representation shall not be conflated. Thus, we keep clear separation of concerns, which is addressed in detailed in the next section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. There is no perfect candidate for representing the conceptual model. And, although not without limitations, risks for misunderstandings and mis-interpretations, we choose (a subset of) UML language [epo-cm2owl] as most appropriate and instrumental in addressing (a) the concern for having a conceptual model established and (b) the concern for providing a graphical representation. The UML appropriateness has been acknowledged based on a longstanding experience and practices. An entire section of this style guide is dedicated to (UML) conceptual model [see Conceptual model conventions]. The subset of the UML language considered in this style guide is comprised (but not limited to) in the following set of UML elements: Class Class Attribute Connector Association Dependency Generalisation Enumeration For visual representation only UML Class Diagrams are considered. Note: UML will be the recommended language for defining the conceptual models until a better and more appropriate alternative with robust tool support is developed, that is also addressing the SEMIC methods and practices [see Architectural clarification]. Definition An ontology, also referred to as ontology specification, is a a formal specification describing the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents (e.g. domain experts) [gruber93]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse [wiki-onto]. Description The ontology constitutes the formal (machine-readable) definition of concepts. Although the languages for expressing ontologies vary in expressivity, we shall keep it light and simple, from the formal point of view, with minimal detail and level of expressivity [SC-R2]. Backer & Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [baker15]. In the SEMIC context, we only consider lightweight ontologies [defined in rule SC-R2]. Therefore, even if this aspect is not emphasised as \"lightweight ontology\", it is implicitly meant even when simple \"ontology\" reference is used. We assume that the ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language [SC-R1]. The main purpose of this component is to declare the classes, properties, datatypes and controlled lists. Each construct is established by assigning a URI and decorating it with human-readable labels and descriptions, and constitutes the mechanism to establish common references for humans and machines. Definition A data shape specification, also referred to as data shape constraint specification, or simply as data shape constraint or data shape, provides a set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated. Description The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language. This document will refer to data shape constraint specifications simply as \"data shapes\", but occasionally also as \"data shape constraints\" or \"data shape specifications\". Definition A data specification document, also referred to as specification document, is the human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape, or a combination of both. Description A data specification document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to understand (a) how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain, and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose. It is to serve as technical documentation for anyone interested in using (e.g. adopting or extending) a semantic data specification (see [What is a semantic data specification?]). We assume that the data specification documents are published in HTML format (optionally, others). See, for example, the Core Person specification [cpv] or the CPSV-AP specification [cpsv-ap]. Definition A data specification artefact, often referred to as specification artefact or simply artefact, is a materialisation of a semantic data specification in a concrete representation that is appropriate for addressing one or more concerns (e.g. use cases, requirements). Description In the SEMIC context, we consider the following artefact types as primary: ontologies, data shapes, and specification documents. For a description of various concerns addressed in the SEMIC context, please see the section [Separation of concerns in SEMIC]. Additionally, we are concerned with syntax bindings and serialisation formats (XML/XSD and JSON-LD in particular). Still, these are not in the scope of this document and are addressed elsewhere. For more, see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. Definition A semantic data specification , often called simply data specification, is a union of machine- and human-readable artefacts addressing clearly defined concerns, interoperability scope and use-cases. A semantic data specification comprises at least an ontology and a data shape (or either of them individually) accompanied by a human-readable data specification. Description One general categorisation of semantic data specifications is along the reuse axis. Some semantic data specifications are built with the intent that the terms of the conceptual model can be used in as much as possible contexts. Typically, it is possible to use the terms independently of each other. In this case, the definitions of the terms are usually very broad and abstract, and only the bare minimum of (usage) constraints are expressed. Often, the terms are presented as a list to the reader, with identifiers for each term in the same namespace. Those semantic data specifications are usually denoted with terms such as vocabularies or terminology. On the other side of the spectrum are the data specifications that precisely encode the semantics of the conceptual model that is being used in a single data exchange context, implemented in software or API. They usually have a strong connection with technical data representations (see section on [Technical artefacts and concerns]) and documentations such as XSD schema, OpenAPI specifications, etc. Conceptual models for this purpose will contain precise constraints, technical datatypes, the code-lists that are being used, refer to implementation decisions, etc. Semantic data specifications that are created for that purpose are denoted with Implementation Models. As that name indicate, their objective is to encode the conceptual model of an implementation. Between those two extremes, i.e. contextfree reuse (vocabularies) and unique usage context (Implementation Models), there are semantic data specifications that aim to capture the conceptual model for a broad, yet well-defined, usage context. Typically, these data specifications do not intend to introduce new terms in the conceptual model, but will exploit terms from other semantic data specifications. These exploited terms are augmented with additional usage constraints making the terms more fit for purpose. These semantic data specifications are often denoted with terms such as Application Profiles or Profiles. Readers should understand that the usage relationships between semantic data specifications form a complex network. An attempt to provide a structured view on this network was initiated in the draft W3C Profile Guide [profile-guide]. Also, the Application Profiles do not necessarily have to address all the technical needs related to an implemented system. Distinction between technical and semantic interoperability layers is attempted in this section. This categorisation along the reuse axis indicates the importance of expressing the interoperability scope for semantic data specifications. However, due to the absence of widely accepted definitions for those categories, outlining the exact Dos and Don’ts (for each category), may result to different expectations for each category. This style guide is a document that defines the commonly accepted and applied rules for SEMIC. In the SEMIC context, two types of semantic data specifications are considered: [Core Vocabulary] and [Application Profile]. Semantic data specifications of the third category, Implementation Models, are not part of the activities of SEMIC. Nevertheless, their existence, is taken into account when building the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. Occasionally, this document will refer to semantic data specifications shortly as \"data specifications\". With a similar meaning, the term \"semantic asset\" is used in the literature (e.g. ADMS [adms]). However, in our understanding, the term \"semantic asset\" is broader than \"data specification\" and includes controlled vocabularies and possibly other types of assets. Definition A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable and extensible data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context. Broad context (on vocabularies) On the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as \"terms\") used to describe and represent an area of concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular application, characterise possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only) [vocab]. There is no clear division between what is referred to as \"vocabulary\" and \"ontology\". The trend is to use the word \"ontology\" for a more complex and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas \"vocabulary\" is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or used only in a very loose sense [vocab]. SEMIC context (on Core Vocabularies) Formally, a Core Vocabulary encompasses a lightweight ontology, and, optionally, a (permissive) data shape specification, and it is expressed in a condensed, comprehensive data specification document. CV = lightweight ontology + (optionally) a (permissive) data shape For more details see section on [Data specification and artefact types]. The qualifications lightweight and permissive are used to better emphasise the intention to be reused in the broadest possible context. More precise boundaries are defined further in this document. NOTE: \"Vocabularies\", in general, are not the same as \"controlled vocabularies\", as the latter usually refers to SKOS artefacts. However, in other contexts (similar to SEMIC), a Core Vocabulary might often be simply denoted as \"vocabulary\". Definition An Application Profile is a data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined application context. It re-uses concepts from one or more semantic data specifications, while adding more specificity, by identifying mandatory, recommended, and optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and providing recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used [dcat-ap]. Description An Application Profile (AP) is a data shape specification which addresses particular application needs (operating within some domain or community) while providing semantic interoperability with other applications based on one or more shared ontologies (vocabularies) [dc-ap]. Formally, the Application Profile encompasses (a) reused ontology specifications (one or many) and (b) its own data shape specification. Optionally it may include (c) reused data shape specifications (one or many), and (d) it may provide its own ontology specification to fill the ontological gaps. AP = reused lightweight ontology + own data shape + (optionally) reused (permissive) data shape + (optionally) own ontology SEMIC context In SEMIC, Application Profiles encompass an ontology, which is largely composed of importing the reused ontologies, complemented with an appropriate data shape specification. Terms that are introduced because of the Application Profile needs are, by preference, added to existing Core Vocabularies. If this is not possible, an Application Profile-specific Vocabulary is created.
